# Infrahub integrations

Infrahub offers robust integrations with both Ansible and Nornir, which facilitate the automation and management of infrastructure tasks.

These integrations elevate Infrahub's functionality, transforming it into a centralized source of truth for infrastructure data while leveraging the robust automation capabilities of Ansible and Nornir. This streamlines the management and automation of infrastructure tasks, ensuring both efficiency and precision.

## Ansible integration

This integration is provided through the `opsmill.infrahub` Ansible Collection. It allows Infrahub to be used as a dynamic inventory source for Ansible, enabling management of infrastructure based on data stored in Infrahub.

## Nornir integration

Nornir is a Python-based automation framework primarily used for network automation. The Infrahub plugin for Nornir enables Infrahub to serve as an inventory source, providing a streamlined solution for managing network devices and configurations.

## Key features

- **Inventory Management**: Infrahub can dynamically generate and update inventories for Ansible and Nornir, ensuring that the latest state of infrastructure is always used.
- **Automation**: By leveraging each framework's automation capabilities, users can execute complex infrastructure management tasks directly from Infrahub data.
- **Configuration Deployment**: These integrations ensure that configurations managed by Infrahub are consistent across the infrastructure by applying them through Ansible or Nornir.

## More information

For more details, you can refer to the [integrations](../integrations/) documentation.
