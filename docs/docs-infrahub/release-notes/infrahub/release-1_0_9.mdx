# Release 1.0.9

This release is a bug-fix release to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.0.8 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Adding `invoke` tasks to assist with release process. ([#4519](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4519))
- Add pagination and backend search in new combobox for relationships.
- Added custom Towncrier template to remove extra space after new Changelog entries.
- In schema viewer, we now display `Hierarchical` value for generics.

### Fixed

- Update delete constraints to correctly account for relationships on generics and relationships for which the peer kind is a generic. ([#4332](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4332))
- Fix error when `pool` was used a relationship name. ([#4807](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4807))
- Ensure that deleted schema nodes are removed from all workers and that the schema is in sync without having to restart. ([#4836](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4836))
- Consistently use "Save" on all object forms submit buttons. ([#4850](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4850))
- Search shortcuts show `Cmd` on macOS and `Ctrl` on other systems. ([#4861](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4861))
- Update the parent relationship query to populate the dropdown options when editing an object, ensuring the current parent is correctly selected for the current node. ([#5035](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5035))
- Correctly refresh menu after access token has expired. ([#5099](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5099))
- On the object permission form, fix the name option selection when changing the namespace to get the latest options and to be able to choose a name option. ([#5100](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5100))
- Prevent adding a new mandatory attribute or relationship to the schema if some nodes are already present in the database. ([#5106](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5106))
- Refresh branch hash on local worker during branch create. ([#5130](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5130))
- Fix uniqueness constraint check with enum based attributes. ([#5132](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5132))
- Editing old `CHANGELOG.md` entries to use uniform formatting from new Towncrier template.
- Store CoreProfile in database to ensure consistent initial schema hash. Prior to this the schema was reported as being out of sync when starting the application for the first time. This error wouldn't have hade any impact but was confusing. The workaround would be to load a schema or restart the application at least once after first time initialization.
- Use the branch uuid instead of the internal database id to track the hash of the schema in the cache.

## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.0.9"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
