# Rendering configurations using transformations

Infrahub can render configurations from the data that it contains. In Infrahub this process is called a transformation. We transform data according to a certain schema in Infrahub to some other format. Examples of this are, a network device configuration file, an OpenConfig payload, inputs to a CloudFormation template, a configuration file for a Linux daemon.

Infrahub has 2 types of transformations:

- Jinja2 transformation
- Python transformation

Please refer to [Transformation topic](/topics/transformation) to learn more about it.

## Generate the configuration of a device using Jinja2

From the `infrahub-demo-git` repository that we imported in the previous section of the tutorial, we imported 2 Jinja2 transformations. We can run the transformation by accessing them via the REST API under `/api/transform/jinja2/<transform_name>` followed by any additional parameters expected in the GraphQL query that the transformation uses.

The imported Jinja2 transform, `device_startup`, expects the name of the device as a parameter `/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=<device_name>`. As an example, below is the URL for couple of devices:

- [Configuration for `ord1-edge1` (`/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=ord1-edge1`)](http://localhost:8000/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=ord1-edge1)
- [Configuration for `atl1-edge2` (`/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=atl1-edge2`)](http://localhost:8000/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=atl1-edge2)

## Create a new branch, then change the data AND the template

Next, we'll create a new branch and make modifications to both the data and the Jinja2 template to explore the integration between the Jinja2 Template Renderer and the storage engine.

### 1. Create a new branch `update-ethernet1`

From the frontend, create a new branch named `update-ethernet1` and make sure to check the toggle `Sync with Git`.

### 2. Update the interface Ethernet 1 for atl1-edge1

Now we'll make a data change in the branch `update-ethernet1` that will be reflected in the rendered template, like updating the description of a device interface.

1. Navigate to the device `atl1-edge1` in the frontend (Menu > Device Management > Network Device > Device)
2. Navigate to the list of its interfaces in the `Interfaces` Tab
3. Select the interface `Ethernet1`
4. Edit the interface `Ethernet`
5. Update its description to `New description in the branch`
6. Save your change

### 3. Update the Jinja2 template in GitHub

The final step is to modify the Jinja template directly from GitHub

In GitHub:

1. Navigate to your clone
2. Select the new branch in the branch menu dropdown
3. Select the file `templates` / `device_startup_config.tpl.j2`
4. Edit the file with the `pen` in the top right corner
5. Delete the lines 77 and 78 (i.e. the last two lines of `ip prefix-list BOGON-Prefixes`)
6. Commit your changes in the branch `update-ethernet1` directly from GitHub

:::success Validate that everything is correct

After making these changes, you should be able to render the transform for the branch `update-ethernet1` and see the changes made to the data AND to the schema at the same time at the address [`/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=atl1-edge1&branch=update-ethernet1`](http://localhost:8000/api/transform/jinja2/device_startup?device=atl1-edge1&branch=update-ethernet1)

:::

### 4. Merge the Branch `update-ethernet1`

After merging the branch `update-ethernet1`, regenerate the configuration for `atl1-edge1` in `main` and validate that the 2 changes are now available in `main`.

## Generate other payloads using Python

As powerful as Jinja templates are, sometimes itâ€™s both cleaner and simpler to work directly in code. An Infrahub Python Transformation lets you do exactly that. Where a Jinja2 transform combines a GraphQL query together with a Jinja template, the Python Transformation combines a GraphQL query with code. You might use a Python Transform instead of a Jinja2 Transformation when you need to return structured data as opposed to a classic text-based configuration file.

From the repository `infrahub-demo-edge` we imported a Python Transformation to render a configuration in the OpenConfig format. In this example, we want to generate OpenConfig interface data.

We can access the Python Transformation through the REST API on the following URL:

```txt
http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python/OCInterfaces?device=ord1-edge1&branch=main
```

Breaking this URL down into components gives us:

- `http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python`: the base URL of Infrahub together with the Python Transformation endpoint.
- `OCInterfaces`: the name of the Python Transformation.
- `?device=ord1-edge1&branch=main`: the query string that provides a list of arguments for the GraphQL query. In this case the name of the device. Together with `branch` to show that we want to run the transform against a specific branch within Infrahub.

Render the OpenConfig interface payload by going to this URL (linked from the above example URL): [generate the OpenConfig Interface payload for `ord1-edge1` on the branch `main`](http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python/OCInterfaces?device=ord1-edge1&branch=main)
