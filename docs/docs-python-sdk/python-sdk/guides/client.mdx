# How to create and configure an Infrahub client

This guide shows you how to create and configure an Infrahub client using the Python SDK. You'll learn how to set up authentication, configure proxy settings, and customize client behavior for your infrastructure automation workflows.

At the end of this guide, you'll have a fully configured client ready to interact with your Infrahub instance.

:::info TL;DR;
If you prefer to jump right in, check out the ["Hello World" example](#hello-world-example) at the end of this guide for a quick reference implementation.
:::

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Infrahub SDK installed (`pip install infrahub-sdk` or `poetry add infrahub-sdk`)
- Access to an Infrahub instance (local or remote)
- Valid credentials (API token or username/password) if authentication is required

## Step 1: Create a client instance

:::info Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Clients
The SDK offers both asynchronous and synchronous client implementations. Choose the one that best fits your application architecture:

- **Asynchronous client** (`InfrahubClient`): Ideal for modern async applications using Python's `async`/`await` syntax
- **Synchronous client** (`InfrahubClientSync`): Better for traditional synchronous workflows or scripts

:::

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
<TabItem value="Async" default>

Create an `InfrahubClient` for async/await workflows:

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient

# Connect to local Infrahub instance
client = InfrahubClient()
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sync">

Create an `InfrahubClientSync` for traditional synchronous code:

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync

# Connect to local Infrahub instance
client = InfrahubClientSync()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Configure authentication and address

Next, configure the address of your Infrahub instance and set up authentication credentials. Infrahub supports two authentication methods: API tokens and username/password.

:::info Configuration Methods
You can configure the client in two ways:

1. **Environment variables**: Ideal for sensitive information
2. **`Config` object**: Better for explicit configuration in code

You can also combine both methods, where the `Config` object takes precedence over environment variables.
:::

You can find the full list of configuration options in the [SDK configuration reference](../reference/config.mdx).

### Using API tokens

API tokens provide secure, long-lived authentication and are the recommended method for most use cases, especially for automation scripts and non-interactive applications.

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
<TabItem value="Async" default>
<Tabs groupId="env-config">
<TabItem value="Code" default>

We can set the address and API token directly in the `Config` object:

```python
from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient
client = InfrahubClient(config=Config(address="http://localhost:8000", api_token="token"))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Environment">

We need to export the address and API token as an environment variable:

```bash
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="token"
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient
client = InfrahubClient() # token and address are read from the INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN and INFRAHUB_ADDRESS environment variables
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sync">
<Tabs groupId="env-config">
<TabItem value="Code" default>

We can set the address and API token directly in the `Config` object:

```python
from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClientSync
client = InfrahubClientSync(config=Config(address="http://localhost:8000", api_token="token"))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Environment">

We need to export the address and API token as an environment variable:

```bash
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="token"
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync
client = InfrahubClientSync() # token and address are read from the INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN and INFRAHUB_ADDRESS environment variables
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using username/password

For interactive authentication, use username and password. The SDK automatically handles JWT token generation and refresh.

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
<TabItem value="Async" default>
<Tabs groupId="env-config">
<TabItem value="Code" default>

We can set the address, username and password directly in the `Config` object:

```python
from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient
client = InfrahubClient(config=Config(address="http://localhost:8000", username="admin", password="infrahub"))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Environment">

We need to export the address, username and password as environment variables:

```bash
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_USERNAME="admin"
export INFRAHUB_PASSWORD="infrahub"
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient
client = InfrahubClient() # username and password are read from the INFRAHUB_USERNAME and INFRAHUB_PASSWORD environment variables
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sync">
<Tabs groupId="env-config">
<TabItem value="Code" default>

We can set the address, username and password directly in the `Config` object:

```python
from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClientSync
client = InfrahubClientSync(config=Config(address="http://localhost:8000", username="admin", password="infrahub"))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Environment">

We need to export the address, username and password as environment variables:

```bash
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_USERNAME="admin"
export INFRAHUB_PASSWORD="infrahub"
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync
client = InfrahubClientSync() # username and password are read from the INFRAHUB_USERNAME and INFRAHUB_PASSWORD environment variables
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success
Your client is now configured and ready to use!
:::

## Step 3: Set the default branch (optional)

Configure your client to work with a specific Infrahub branch instead of the default `main` branch. This is particularly useful when working on feature branches or experimental changes, as it eliminates the need to specify the branch name in every method call.

<Tabs groupId="env-config">
<TabItem value="Code" default>

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient, Config
config = Config(address="http://localhost:8000", api_token="token", default_branch="other-branch")
client_other_branch = InfrahubClient(config=config)

tag_other_branch = await client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED")
tag_main_branch = await client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED", branch="main")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Environment">

```bash
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="token"
export INFRAHUB_DEFAULT_BRANCH="other-branch"
```

```python
from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient
client_other_branch = InfrahubClient()

tag_other_branch = await client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED")
tag_main_branch = await client_other_branch.get(kind="BuiltinTag", name__value="RED", branch="main")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success Branch Configuration
Your client is now configured to use the specified default branch instead of `main`. Remember that you can always override this setting by explicitly passing the `branch` argument to any method call.
:::

## Hello world example

Let's create a simple "Hello World" example to verify your client configuration works correctly. This example will connect to your Infrahub instance and query the available accounts.

1. Create a new file called `hello_world.py`:

```bash
touch hello_world.py
```

:::danger File Naming
Avoid naming your script `test.py` as this name could conflict with Python's testing modules.
:::

2. Add the following code to `hello_world.py`:

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
<TabItem value="Async" default>

```python
import asyncio

from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient


async def hello_world():
    client = InfrahubClient(config=Config(address="http://localhost:8000"))

    # Try to query accounts to validate connection
    try:
        accounts = await client.all(kind="CoreAccount")
        print(f"Successfully connected to Infrahub! Found {len(accounts)} account(s)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Something went wrong: {e}")


asyncio.run(hello_world())
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sync">

```python
from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClientSync


# Test connection and authentication
def hello_world():
    client = InfrahubClientSync(config=Config(address="http://localhost:8000"))

    # Try to query accounts to validate connection
    try:
        accounts = client.all(kind="CoreAccount")
        print(f"Successfully connected to Infrahub! Found {len(accounts)} account(s)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Something went wrong: {e}")


hello_world()
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Export the necessary environment variables:

```bash
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec" # This is the default token
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
python hello_world.py
```

If everything is configured correctly, you should see:

:::success
`Successfully connected to Infrahub! Found 1 account(s)`
:::

## Advanced use cases

### Enable debug logging

When developing or troubleshooting, you can enable GraphQL query logging to see exactly what requests are being sent to Infrahub:

<Tabs groupId="env-config">
  <TabItem value="Code" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient
  config = Config(echo_graphql_queries=True)
  client = InfrahubClient(config=config)
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Environment">

  ```bash
  export INFRAHUB_ECHO_GRAPHQL_QUERIES=true
  ```

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient
  client = InfrahubClient()  # debug flag state is read from the INFRAHUB_ECHO_GRAPHQL_QUERIES environment variables
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure proxy settings

When operating in environments with restricted network access or behind corporate firewalls, you can configure the client to route requests through HTTP/HTTPS proxies.

#### Single proxy for all requests

To route all traffic through the same proxy server, use the `INFRAHUB_PROXY` environment variable or the `proxy` configuration parameter:

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
  <TabItem value="Async" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClient
  config = Config(proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080")
  client = InfrahubClient(config=config)

  # Or using environment variable
  # export INFRAHUB_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
  client = InfrahubClient()
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync">

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import Config, InfrahubClientSync
  config = Config(proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080")
  client = InfrahubClientSync(config=config)

  # Or using environment variable
  # export INFRAHUB_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
  client = InfrahubClientSync()
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Separate proxies for HTTP and HTTPS

In some network environments, you might need to route HTTP and HTTPS traffic through different proxy servers. Use the `INFRAHUB_PROXY_MOUNTS_HTTP` and `INFRAHUB_PROXY_MOUNTS_HTTPS` environment variables for this purpose:

```bash
export INFRAHUB_PROXY_MOUNTS_HTTP=http://http-proxy.example.com:8080
export INFRAHUB_PROXY_MOUNTS_HTTPS=http://https-proxy.example.com:8080
```

<Tabs groupId="async-sync">
  <TabItem value="Async" default>

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClient
  # Proxy configuration is read from environment variables
  client = InfrahubClient()
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Sync">

  ```python
  from infrahub_sdk import InfrahubClientSync
  # Proxy configuration is read from environment variables
  client = InfrahubClientSync()
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger Using both `proxy` and `proxy_mounts`
The `proxy` and `proxy_mounts` configurations are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. Specifying both will cause a `ValueError` to be raised when the client is initialized.
