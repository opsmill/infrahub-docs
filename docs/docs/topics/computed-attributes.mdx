title: Computed attributes
---

The computed attributes feature enables the dynamic calculation of attribute values based on user-defined logic. Currently, Infrahub supports two main types of computed attributes: **Jinja2** and **Python**.

## Jinja2 Computed Attributes {#jinja-computed-attribute}

Users can input a concise Jinja2 template directly within the schema definition. Any change to any field used to compute the value will automatically update it.

See the [guide](../guides/computed-attributes) for instructions on creating Jinja2 computed attribute in Infrahub.

### Limitations

- Jinja2 computed attributes cannot reference relationships with cardinality `many`.
- Only direct relationships can be used (i.e., a relationship of a relationship is not accessible).
- Only `URL` and `Text` attribute kinds are supported at the moment.

## Python Computed Attributes {#python-computed-attribute}

Python computed attributes leverage Infrahub's [Python transform](./transformation.mdx) feature. Users can define which transformation to apply directly within the schema. The computation of the value is delegated to workers as asynchronous tasks, which may cause the value to take a few seconds to update.

Python scripts do not have the limitations of Jinja2 computed attributes and can include more complex logic, including relationships with cardinality `many` and nested relationships.

See the [guide](../guides/computed-attributes) for instructions on creating Python computed attribute in Infrahub.

### Limitations

- Python computed attributes cannot be used on mandatory attribute.
- Complex scripts can impact system performance.
- Only `URL` and `Text` attribute kinds are supported at the moment.

## Choosing Between Jinja2 and Python

Computed attribute kind | Mandatory attributes | Relationship limitations                  | Complexity Handling
------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------
Jinja2                  | Compatible           | No use of `many` cardinality; direct only | Straightforward operations
Python                  | Not compatible       | No limitations                            | Handles complex logic
