title: Computed attributes
---

The computed attributes feature enables the dynamic calculation of attribute values based on user-defined logic.

Currently, Infrahub supports two main types of computed attributes:

* **Jinja2** – Lightweight, but limited in relationship handling.
* **Python** – More flexible and powerful, but requires async execution.

::::info Limitations

Computed attributes have some inherent restrictions due to system constraints and performance considerations. Keep these in mind when designing your schema:

* Computed attributes **can only** be used on nodes, not generics.
* Only `URL` and `Text` attribute kinds are supported for computed attributes.

## Jinja2 computed attributes {#jinja-computed-attribute}

Users can input a concise Jinja2 template directly within the schema definition. Any change to any field used to compute the value will automatically update it.

See the [guide](../guides/computed-attributes) for instructions on creating Jinja2 computed attribute in Infrahub.

### Restrictions

::::warning

* Jinja2 computed attributes **cannot** reference relationships with cardinality `many`.
* Only **direct** relationships can be used (i.e., a relationship of a relationship is not accessible).

::::

## Python computed attributes {#python-computed-attribute}

Python computed attributes leverage Infrahub's [Python transform](./transformation.mdx) feature. Users can define which transformation to apply directly within the schema. The computation of the value is delegated to workers as asynchronous tasks, which may cause the value to take a few seconds to update.

Python scripts do not have the limitations of Jinja2 computed attributes and can include more complex logic, including relationships with cardinality `many` and nested relationships.

See the [guide](../guides/computed-attributes) for instructions on creating Python computed attribute in Infrahub.

### Restrictions

::::warning

* Mandatory attributes **cannot** use Python computed attributes.
* Complex scripts **may impact system performance**.

## Choosing Between Jinja2 and Python

| Computed Attribute Kind | Mandatory Attribute Support | Relationship Constraints                                 | Complexity Handling                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Jinja2**              | ✅ Supported                | Cannot use `many` cardinality; only direct relationships | Best for straightforward operations   |
| **Python**              | ❌ Not supported            | No restrictions                                          | Suitable for complex logic            |
