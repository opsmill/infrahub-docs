This page outlines the hardware requirements for running Infrahub, including minimum and recommended specifications, enterprise sizing, cloud provider machine types, and a utility for benchmarking your system's performance.

If you only want to try Infrahub, follow the [quick start](../getting-started/quick-start.mdx).

## General hardware requirements

The system on which you want to run Infrahub should meet the following requirements:

| Level       | CPU Cores | RAM  | Storage / database (Neo4j) |
|-------------|-----------|------|----------------------------|
| Minimum     | 6         | 12GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Recommended | 8         | 16GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |

For cloud deployments, use at least the following machine types:

| Cloud provider              | Machine type       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| Google Cloud Platform       | c4d-standard-4     |
| Amazon Web Services         | m8a.xlarge         |
| Microsoft Azure             | Standard_D4as_v7   |
| Oracle Cloud Infrastructure | VM.Standard.E6     |
| Alibaba Cloud               | ecs.g9a.xlarge     |

## Enterprise sizing <EnterpriseBadge />

For enterprise deployments, use these guidelines:

| Enterprise Product | CPU Cores | RAM  | Storage / database (Neo4j) |
|--------------------|-----------|------|----------------------------|
| Small              | 8         | 16GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Medium Data        | 16        | 32GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Medium Action      | 16        | 32GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Large Data         | 32        | 64GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |
| Large Action       | 32        | 64GB | SSD and/or >= 5000 IOPS    |

## Performance benchmark utility

To evaluate your system's performance, use our benchmarking utility. It tests CPU, memory, and disk IOPS.

:::note

Even with the right amount of CPU cores and memory, other factors such as CPU speed can impact Infrahub performance.

Run the tool using Docker:

```shell title="❯ docker run --pull always --rm registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/bench"
docker run --pull always --rm registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/bench
```
