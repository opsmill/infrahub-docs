title: Resource manager
---

Resource managers in Infrahub automate the allocation of network resources from predefined pools, eliminating manual assignment and preventing conflicts across your infrastructure. This system ensures consistent resource allocation while maintaining complete visibility and control over your available resources.

## Core concepts

### What is a resource manager?

A resource manager is a system component that automatically allocates resources from pools when creating or updating infrastructure objects. Instead of manually tracking available IP addresses, VLAN IDs, or other resources in spreadsheets, you define pools and let Infrahub handle the allocation.

Resource managers support three primary types of pools:

- **IP Address Pools** (`CoreIPAddressPool`) - Allocate individual IP addresses from IP prefixes
- **IP Prefix Pools** (`CoreIPPrefixPool`) - Allocate smaller subnets from larger IP prefixes
- **Number Pools** (`CoreNumberPool`) - Allocate sequential numbers for attributes like VLAN IDs, ASNs, or circuit IDs

### Branch-agnostic allocation

One of the most powerful features of Infrahub's resource managers is branch-agnostic allocation. When you allocate a resource in any branch, that allocation is immediately reserved across all branches in your system. This prevents conflicts when merging branches and ensures resource uniqueness across your entire infrastructure.

Consider this scenario:

1. You create a new branch "datacenter-expansion"
2. You allocate IP address 10.0.0.50 to a new device in this branch
3. Another team member working in a different branch "network-refresh" tries to allocate the same IP
4. Infrahub prevents the duplicate allocation, even though the branches haven't been merged

This behavior guarantees that resources remain unique and conflict-free when branches are eventually merged back to main.

### Idempotent allocation

Resource managers support idempotent allocation through the use of identifiers. When you include an `identifier` parameter in your allocation request, the same resource will be returned on repeated calls:

```graphql
mutation {
  IPAddressPoolGetResource(data: {
    id: "<pool-id>",
    identifier: "web-server-primary-ip",
  })
}
```

This feature is essential for:

- Automated workflows that may run multiple times
- [Generators](./generator.mdx) that need consistent results

## Pool types and use cases

### IP address pools

IP address pools allocate individual addresses from one or more IP prefixes. Common use cases include:

- **Device management IPs**: Loopback addresses for routers and switches
- **Server primary IPs**: Management interfaces for compute infrastructure
- **Service endpoints**: Load balancer VIPs, anycast addresses
- **Point-to-point links**: Interface addresses for interconnections

Key features:

- Automatic allocation of the next available address
- Support for both IPv4 and IPv6
- Ability to combine multiple prefixes in a single pool
- Optional allocation weighting for preferred ranges

### IP prefix pools

IP prefix pools allocate subnets from larger prefixes. Typical applications:

- **Customer allocations**: Assign /29 or /28 blocks to customers
- **Site networks**: Allocate /24 networks to new locations
- **Service subnets**: Reserve ranges for specific applications
- **Point-to-point links**: Allocate /30 or /31 prefixes for interconnects

Key features:

- Configurable prefix length for allocations
- Efficient subnet management and tracking
- Hierarchical allocation support
- Visual representation of utilization

### Number pools

Number pools manage sequential numeric identifiers. Common scenarios:

- **VLAN IDs**: Ranges 100-1000 for data VLANs, 2000-3000 for voice
- **ASN allocation**: Private ASN ranges for BGP deployments
- **Circuit IDs**: Sequential numbering for service provisioning
- **Interface indices**: Consistent numbering across devices

Key features:

- Define start and end ranges
- Automatic sequential allocation
- Skip already-used values
- Support for any numeric attribute

## Allocation methods

### Direct allocation

Direct allocation creates a standalone resource from a pool. Use this when:

- Pre-provisioning resources for future use
- Creating resources that will be assigned later
- Building resource inventories
- Testing pool configurations

Example: Allocating an IP address for future assignment:

```graphql
mutation {
  IPAddressPoolGetResource(data: {
    id: "<pool-id>",
    data: {
      description: "Reserved for new web server"
    }
  })
}
```

### Relationship resource allocation

Relationship allocation assigns resources during object creation. This method:

- Ensures atomic operations (object and resource created together)
- Maintains referential integrity
- Simplifies workflows
- Reduces manual steps

Example: Creating a device with automatic IP allocation:

```graphql
mutation {
  InfraDeviceCreate(data: {
    name: {value: "spine-01"},
    primary_ip: {
      from_pool: {
        id: "<pool-id>"
      }
    }
  })
}
```

## Advanced features

### Weighted allocation

For IP pools containing multiple resources, you can control allocation priority using weights. Resources inherit from `CoreWeightedPoolResource` gain an `allocation_weight` attribute:

```yaml
nodes:
  - name: IPPrefix
    namespace: Ipam
    inherit_from:
      - "BuiltinIPPrefix"
      - "CoreWeightedPoolResource"
```

Higher weight values are allocated first. This enables scenarios like:

- Preferring certain IP ranges for specific device types
- Gradually migrating between address spaces
- Implementing allocation policies

### Pool composition

Pools can contain multiple resources, providing flexibility in resource management:

- Combine non-contiguous IP ranges in a single pool
- Aggregate prefixes from different sites or providers
- Create logical groupings independent of network topology

### Allocation tracking

Infrahub provides comprehensive visibility into resource utilization:

- View all allocated resources from a pool
- Track allocation history and timestamps
- Identify which branch allocated each resource
- Monitor pool utilization percentages
- Export allocation reports

## Integration patterns

### With generators

Resource managers integrate seamlessly with [generators](./generator.mdx) to create fully automated provisioning workflows:

- Template configurations with dynamically allocated IPs
- Generate DNS records based on allocations
- Create monitoring configurations automatically

### In CI/CD pipelines

Incorporate resource allocation into your automation:

- Allocate resources during infrastructure deployment
- Validate resource availability before provisioning
- Clean up resources when decommissioning
- Implement approval workflows for resource requests

### API integration

Resource managers expose full functionality through GraphQL APIs:

- Build custom allocation interfaces
- Integrate with external IPAM systems
- Create resource request portals
- Implement custom allocation logic

## Best practices

### Pool design

- **Size pools appropriately**: Balance between too many small pools and unwieldy large ones
- **Use descriptive names**: "Campus-WiFi-Management" rather than "Pool1"
- **Document pool purposes**: Include descriptions explaining intended use
- **Plan for growth**: Size pools with future expansion in mind

### Allocation strategies

- **Use identifiers for automation**: Ensure idempotent behavior in scripts
- **Allocate early in workflows**: Reserve resources before lengthy provisioning
- **Clean up unused allocations**: Implement processes to reclaim resources
- **Monitor utilization**: Set alerts for pools approaching capacity

### Organizational considerations

- **Define ownership**: Assign pools to teams or services
- **Implement naming conventions**: Standardize how pools are named and organized
- **Create allocation policies**: Document when to use which pools
- **Regular audits**: Review allocations for accuracy and cleanup opportunities
