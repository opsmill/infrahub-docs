# Understanding Infrahub community vs enterprise

Infrahub is available in two distinct editions designed to meet different organizational needs: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. This topic explains the differences between these editions to help you choose the right version for your infrastructure management needs.

## Introduction

Infrahub follows an open-core business model that balances open source accessibility with commercial sustainability. Under this model:

- **Community Edition**: The foundational platform available as open source under Apache 2.0 license
- **Enterprise Edition**: Extended capabilities with additional features, optimizations, and professional support

Both editions share the same core infrastructure data management functionality but differ in areas of scalability, support, and advanced features. The choice between Community and Enterprise depends on your organization's scale, performance requirements, support needs, and integration complexity.

## Community edition

### Philosophy and purpose

Infrahub Community Edition represents the open source foundation of the platform. It's built with several key principles in mind:

- **Democratized access**: Making high-quality infrastructure management accessible to all
- **Transparency**: Full source code visibility under the Apache 2.0 license
- **Community contribution**: Enabling users to extend and improve the platform
- **Production readiness**: Providing a complete, functional solution out of the box

The Community Edition serves as both a complete solution for many organizations and a foundation for those who may later require enterprise features. It maintains feature parity with Enterprise for all core infrastructure data management capabilities.

### Ideal use cases

#### Small to medium organizations

- Teams managing infrastructure with fewer than 1,000 network devices
- Organizations with straightforward deployment requirements
- Companies comfortable with community-based support channels

#### Development and testing environments

- Proof of concepts and pilot deployments
- Development teams learning infrastructure automation
- Testing and validation environments

#### Open source advocates

- Organizations requiring full source code access
- Teams contributing to the Infrahub ecosystem
- Companies with open-source-first policies

### Key characteristics

#### Licensing and access

### Performance and scalability

This area represents one of the most significant differences between the editions, with Enterprise Edition providing substantial enhancements for large-scale deployments.

#### Community edition characteristics

- **Scale capacity**: Suitable for infrastructures up to ~1,000 devices
- **Database optimization**: Standard optimization suitable for moderate workloads
- **Caching**: Basic caching and query optimization
- **Deployment model**: Single-instance deployment patterns
- **Scaling approach**: Vertical scaling through increased resources
