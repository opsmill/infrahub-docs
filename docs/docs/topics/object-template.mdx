title: Object Template
---

In many infrastructures, multiple instances of objects share a common structure. Consider network devices: we know in advance the port setup for a given model. When documenting this in our source of truth, repeatedly entering the same port details is both inefficient and error-prone. The Object Template feature allows you to create a reusable blueprint for any object. This blueprint can be used to generate multiple instances that adhere to the predefined structure, ensuring uniformity while reducing manual effort.

Within a template, you can define:

- **Node attributes** - Standard properties and characteristics of the object.
- **Relationships** - Connections to other nodes in the infrastructure.
- **Components** - Sub-elements or modules that belong to the object.

When creating a new object instance, users can optionally select a template. If chosen, Infrahub automatically applies the corresponding template. Users can then customize each instance by overriding specific attributes or relationships, ensuring both flexibility and consistency.

See the [object-template guide](../guides/object-template) for more information.

## Component relationship

When enabling template generation on a given schema node, Infrahub automatically detects whether the object has any component relationships. If it does, Infrahub will generate corresponding templates for those related objects as well.

## Limitations

- Templates are created only for component relationships. Other types of relationships will continue to reference actual objects in the database rather than templates.
- Modifications to a template will not retroactively update objects that were previously created using that template.
