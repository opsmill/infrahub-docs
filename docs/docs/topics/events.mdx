Please reach out on Discord if you have some questions about **Infrahub events**

:::

The **Event framework** in Infrahub tracks all significant operations and changes within the system.
Every key mutation generates a corresponding event, creating a comprehensive record of what happens in your infrastructure.

For example, some of the events include:

* `infrahub.node.created`
* `infrahub.node.updated`
* `infrahub.node.deleted`
* `infrahub.group.member.added`
* `infrahub.group.member.removed`
* `infrahub.branch.created`
* `infrahub.branch.deleted`

You can find the exhaustive list of events in the [Infrahub events](../reference/infrahub-events.mdx) page.

These events serve multiple purposes:

* They feed the [activity log](./activity-log.mdx), providing a detailed, chronological timeline of system changes.
* They enable event-driven automation, such as triggering [webhooks](./webhooks.mdx).
