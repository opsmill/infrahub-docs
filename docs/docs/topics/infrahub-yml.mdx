# Understanding the `.infrahub.yml` configuration file

The `.infrahub.yml` file serves as the central manifest that defines how Infrahub integrates with external Git repositories. This topic explains the role of this configuration file and the design philosophy behind its structure.

## Why `.infrahub.yml` exists

Infrastructure automation requires both structured data (device inventories, network topologies) and executable code (templates, validation scripts, generators). The `.infrahub.yml` file solves the fundamental challenge of bridging these two worlds by:

- **Declaring intent**: Explicitly stating what resources from a Git repository should be imported into Infrahub
- **Enabling selective integration**: Allowing fine-grained control over which files and resources are processed
- **Providing metadata**: Supplying the necessary context for Infrahub to properly interpret and use repository contents

## Design philosophy and structure

The `.infrahub.yml` file follows a declarative approach where you specify *what* should happen rather than *how* it should happen. This design choice reflects several key principles:

### Explicit over implicit

Rather than scanning the entire repository and making assumptions about file purposes, the configuration file requires explicit declaration of all resources. This approach:

- Prevents unexpected imports of unintended files
- Makes the integration surface clear and auditable
- Allows for different file organizations across repositories

### Resource types

The configuration organizes resources into distinct categories based on their purpose and processing requirements:

- **Executable code**: Python transformations, generators, and checks
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates for configuration generation
- **Schema definitions**: Data models for infrastructure representation
- **Data definitions**: Object files for storing infrastructure data
- **Query definitions**: GraphQL queries for data retrieval
- **Menu definitions**: UI navigation structure definitions

Each category has its own processing pipeline and validation requirements, reflecting the different ways Infrahub handles these resource types.

### Metadata richness

Beyond basic file paths, the configuration captures essential metadata about how resources should be used:

- **Dependencies**: Linking transformations to their required GraphQL queries
- **Targeting**: Specifying which infrastructure groups a resource applies to
- **Parameters**: Defining the inputs required for executable resources
- **Naming**: Providing human-readable identifiers for UI and API access

## Loading behavior and dependency management

The `.infrahub.yml` file controls not just *what* gets loaded, but *how* and *when* resources are processed:

### Processing order

Infrahub processes configuration sections in a specific order to handle dependencies:

1. **Schemas**: Loaded first to establish the data model
2. **GraphQL queries**: Loaded before resources that depend on them
3. **Objects**: Loaded to populate initial data
4. **Python files**: Check definitions, Python transformations, and generators are loaded together
5. **Jinja2 transformations**: Loaded after their required queries are available
6. **Artifact definitions**: Loaded last to reference existing transformations

### File vs. directory handling

When you specify a directory in any resource list:

- Infrahub processes all relevant files within that directory
- Files are processed in alphabetical order
- Subdirectories are processed recursively

This behavior enables you to organize complex repositories while maintaining predictable loading order.

### Dependency resolution

The configuration enables Infrahub to resolve dependencies between resources:

- Transformations reference their required GraphQL queries by name
- Artifact definitions reference transformations and target groups
- Generators specify their data dependencies through query requirements

This dependency management ensures that all resources have what they need when they execute.

## Group targeting

Many definitions in `.infrahub.yml` use [groups](./groups.mdx) to specify their targets:

- **Artifact definitions** - The `targets` field references a group name to specify which objects should generate artifacts
- **Generator definitions** - The `targets` field specifies the group for generated objects
- **Check definitions** - The `targets` field indicates which group to validate

Groups provide a flexible way to target operations across multiple objects without hardcoding specific object lists. This design decouples resource definitions from infrastructure changes - you can add or remove objects from groups without modifying the configuration files.

Example targeting in `.infrahub.yml`:

```yaml
artifact_definitions:
  - name: "Router Configuration"
    targets: "ProductionRouters"  # References a group
    transformation: "router_config_transform"

check_definitions:
  - name: "Interface Validation"
    targets: "NetworkDevices"     # References a different group
    class_name: "InterfaceCheck"
```

See [organizing objects with groups](../guides/groups.mdx) for details on creating target groups.

## Version control and branch behavior

The `.infrahub.yml` file itself is version-controlled, enabling sophisticated integration patterns:

### Branch-specific configuration

Different Git branches can have different `.infrahub.yml` files:

- Development branches can include experimental resources
- Production branches can exclude debug or testing resources
- Feature branches can temporarily modify resource definitions

This flexibility allows teams to maintain different configurations for different environments or development stages.

### Evolution and migration

As your infrastructure automation evolves, the configuration file supports:

- Adding new resource types without affecting existing ones
- Deprecating old resources by removing them from the configuration
- Refactoring resource organization while maintaining functionality

This approach helps teams manage the lifecycle of infrastructure automation components with minimal disruption.

## Future evolution and extensibility

The `.infrahub.yml` format is designed to evolve with Infrahub's capabilities:

- New resource types can be added without breaking existing configurations
- Additional metadata fields can be introduced with backward compatibility
- Processing behavior can be enhanced while maintaining existing semantics

This future-proof design ensures that your automation investments remain valuable as Infrahub grows.

## Conclusion

The `.infrahub.yml` configuration file is a crucial bridge between Git repositories and Infrahub's infrastructure management capabilities. By understanding its design principles and structure, you can effectively organize your infrastructure automation resources and leverage Infrahub's full potential to manage your network infrastructure.
