title: Event Rules and Actions
---

The event framework allows you to respond to [events](./events.mdx) as they occur within Infrahub by defining filter conditions and triggering actions.
By creating multiple rules and actions, you can build automated workflows.

## How it works

1. **Define trigger rules** that match specific events
2. **Set filter conditions** to narrow down which events should trigger actions
3. **Configure actions** to execute when conditions are met

## Example workflows

### Adding devices to active group

**Workflow:**

1. Device is updated → status changed to "active"
2. Node trigger rule detects the change
3. Group action adds device to "active-devices" group
4. Group member added event is generated
5. Generator action runs for the new member

**Implementation:**

1. **Node Trigger Rule**
   * Matches `infrahub.node.updated` events when a device's `status` changes to "active"
   * Executes a group action to add the device to the "active-devices" group

2. **Group Trigger Rule**
   * Matches `infrahub.group.member_added` events for the "active-devices" group
   * Runs a generator definition targeting the newly added member

### Removing devices from active group

**Workflow:**

1. Device is updated → status changed from "active"
2. Node trigger rule detects the change
3. Group action removes device from "active-devices" group

## Trigger rules

Trigger rules are nodes that inherit from the `CoreTriggerRule` generic and match against specific event types:

| Rule Type | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `CoreNodeTriggerRule` | Filters on mutations to specific nodes | Match changes to attributes or relationships |
| `CoreGroupTriggerRule` | Filters on changes to specific groups | Match when members are added or removed |

### Configuring node trigger rule

When setting up a node trigger rule:

1. Select the node kind to match against
2. Create match filters for specific attributes or relationships
3. Set the trigger to active when configuration is complete

#### Match filters

:::info
By default, a trigger rule will match any change for the given mutation type (added/updated).
You can define additional filters by adding match conditions.

**All conditions must be satisfied** - Match filters use logical AND, not OR

:::

**Attribute matches** - Filter based on:

* New value - Match the attribute's value after the change
* Previous value - Match the attribute's value before the change
* Both - Match both before and after values for transition detection

**Relationship matches** - Filter based on:

* Modification type - Choose whether the relationship was added, removed, or modified
* Peer - Specify which node type/instance should be on the other side of the relationship

:::info Example

To trigger only when a device's status changes from "inactive" to "active", create an attribute match with:

* Previous value = "inactive"
* New value = "active"

:::

:::success Best Practice
The trigger needs to be marked as active before it starts to filter on events

Keep the trigger inactive until you've configured all match conditions to prevent premature execution.

## Actions

Actions are nodes that inherit from the `CoreAction` generic:

| Action Type | Description | Effect |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| `CoreGeneratorAction` | Runs a generator definition | Uses impacted objects as input |
| `CoreGroupAction` | Modifies group membership | Adds or removes members from a group |

:::info

## Use cases

### Automated nodes grouping

When a node with a specific attribute or relationship is created, automatically add it to a group:

1. Create a group action to add nodes to a group
2. Create a node trigger rule for node creation
3. Add an attribute or relationship match to detect the specific condition
4. Configure it to run your group action when the condition is met

### Automated resource creation

When an object is added to a group (or when a attribute changes), automatically create related resources:

1. Create a generator action linked to your resource creation generator
2. Create a group trigger rule for the group
3. Configure it to run your generator action when a member is added
