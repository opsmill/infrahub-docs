# Developer guide

Infrahub support various form of extensibility that rely on users providing their own code that then will be executed by Infrahub.
This guide provides best practices to help you develop robust, efficient, and maintainable extensions.

The following features in Infrahub are based on user provided code :

- [**Transforms** (Python and Jinja2)](./transformation.mdx): Used to generate [Artifacts](./artifact.mdx) and define [Computed Attributes](./computed-attributes.mdx).
- [**Generators**](./generator.mdx): Automate complex tasks by generating outputs dynamically.
- [**Checks**](./check.mdx): Validate your infrastructure with custom rules.

## Development lifecycle

### Development

#### Execute your code locally

During development, you can use the `infrahubctl` CLI to execute your code locally. This provides an environment similar to Infrahub's execution environment, enabling quick testing without deploying your code.

Key points:

- Your code can be executed locally without needing to be checked into Git or pushed to the server.
- GraphQL queries, if required, will be discovered and executed locally.
- The branch to use in Infrahub can be auto-detected from Git or specified explicitly in the CLI.

Refer to the command documentation for details:

| Command                        | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`infrahubctl transform`]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-transform) | Execute Python transforms locally.                          |
| [`infrahubctl render`]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-render)       | Render Jinja2 transforms locally.                           |
| [`infrahubctl generator`]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-generator) | Test custom generators.                                     |
| [`infrahubctl check`]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-check)         | Run local checks                                            |

#### Typing & protocols (Python)

Infrahub supports Python Typing and Protocols to improve the developer experience by providing static analysis and detecting issues early.

:::info What are Protocols?

Protocols are a way to define structural subtyping in Python, allowing you to specify expected behavior without requiring inheritance. Infrahub leverages this to enforce typing for flexible schemas.

:::

##### Generating protocols

You can generate Protocols for your schema with the `infrahubctl protocols` command. The schema can be provided locally or pulled from a running Infrahub instance.

```shell
infrahubctl protocols --schema my-schema.yaml --output protocols.py
```

> If you don’t have a Python module, save the protocols in a protocols.py file in the same directory as your script.

##### Using protocols in code

The python SDK natively supports Protocol in place of `kind` for most functions that interact with objects (`all`, `filters`, `get`, `create`)

```python
# With Protocols
from infrahub_sdk.protocols import BuiltinTag

tags = await client.all(kind=BuiltinTag)
for tag in tags:
    print(tag.name.value)  # Type-safe access to the 'name' attribute
```

Same code without Protocols

```python
# Without Protocols
tags = await client.all(kind="BuiltinTag")
for tag in tags:
    print(tag.name.value)  # May raise type errors as attributes are not checked
```

:::info Protocol for Infrahub Schema

Protocols for all objects natively provided by Infrahub are available within the SDK in `infrahub_sdk.protocols`

:::

#### Git integration

Infrahub integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing you to use your current branch name as the default branch. To enable this feature, set the environment variable:

```shell
export INFRAHUB_DEFAULT_BRANCH_FROM_GIT=true
```

### Testing

Testing is crucial for maintaining high-quality code. Infrahub provides a testing framework based on Pytest to simplify unit and integration tests.

Refer to the [Testing Framework Documentation](./resources-testing-framework.mdx) for details.

:::warning Under Construction

This section is still under development. Contact the team via Discord for additional resources.

## Logging (Python)

You can use Python’s standard logging library to gain insights into the execution of your code. Infrahub captures logs from the `infrahub.tasks` logger by default.

The logger `infrahub.tasks` is configure by default and it's possible to configure additional loggers using the settings (see below)

```python
import logging

log = logging.getLogger("infrahub.tasks")
log.info("This log will be captured within the task")
```

### Configuring additional loggers

To capture logs from additional loggers, configure them using the environment variable `INFRAHUB_WORKFLOW_EXTRA_LOGGERS`.
The level of the extra loggers can be controlled with the environment variable `INFRAHUB_WORKFLOW_EXTRA_LOG_LEVEL`.

```shell
export INFRAHUB_WORKFLOW_EXTRA_LOGGERS = '["mylogger", "otherlogger"]'
export INFRAHUB_WORKFLOW_EXTRA_LOG_LEVEL = "DEBUG"
```
