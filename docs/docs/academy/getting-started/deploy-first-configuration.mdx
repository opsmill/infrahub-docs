## Introduction

Infrastructure as Code is essential for modern infrastructure management, but traditional tools often lack proper data organization and version control capabilities. Infrahub solves this challenge by providing a centralized hub where infrastructure data, templates, and deployment logic work together seamlessly.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to leverage Infrahub's artifact generation system to create and deploy network device configurations based on structured data and templates.

## What you'll learn

By the end of this hands-on tutorial, you'll master the following skills:

- Creating focused GraphQL queries to extract specific infrastructure data
- Building reusable Jinja2 templates for generating device configurations
- Integrating queries and templates using Infrahub's transformation system
- Testing configuration changes safely using Infrahub's branching capabilities
- Validating generated artifacts before deployment to production
