# Creating a Python transform

Within Infrahub a [Transform](../topics/transformation.mdx) is defined in an [external repository](../topics/repository.mdx). However, during development and troubleshooting it is easiest to start from your local computer and run the Transform using [infrahubctl transform]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-transform).

The goal of this guide is to develop a Python Transform and add it to Infrahub, we will achieve this by following these steps.

1. Identify the relevant data you want to extract from the database using a [GraphQL query](../topics/graphql.mdx), that can take an input parameter to filter the data
2. Write a Python script that use the GraphQL query to read information from the system and transforms the data into a new format
3. Create an entry for the Transform within an .infrahub.yml file.
4. Create a Git repository
5. Test the Transform with infrahubctl
6. Add the repository to Infrahub as an external repository
7. Validate that the Transform works by using the Transform API endpoint

## 1. Loading a schema

In this guide we are going to work with a very simplistic network device model. It won't provide a transform that is very useful, the goal is instead to show how the transforms are created. Once you have mastered the basics you will be ready to go on to create more advanced transforms.

```yaml
---
version: "1.0"
nodes:
  - name: Device
    namespace: Network
    display_labels:
      - name__value
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        label: Name
        optional: false
        unique: true
      - name: description
        kind: Text
        label: Description
        optional: true
```

Store the schema as a YAML file on your local disk, and load the schema into Infrahub using the following command

```bash
infrahubctl schema load /path/to/schema.yml
```

## 2. Creating a query to collect the desired data

As the first step we need to have some data in the database to actually query.

Create three devices, called "switch1", "switch2", "switch3", either using the frontend or by submitting three GraphQL mutations as per below (just swapping out the name of the color each time).

```graphql
mutation CreateDevice {
  NetworkDeviceCreate(
    data: {name: {value: "switch1"}, description: {value: "This is device switch1"}}
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

The next step is to create a query that returns the data we just created. The rest of this guide assumes that the following query will return a response similar to the response below the query.

:::info Convert query to Infrahub SDK objects
We provide `convert_query_response` option to be toggled to be able to access objects from the GraphQL query as Infrahub SDK objects rather than the raw dictionary response.

This allows you to manage the returned data with helper methods on the SDK objects such as `save`, `fetch`, etc. on the returned data rather than having to build a payload to send back to Infrahub to manage the objects.

  <TabItem value="Non-converted query response">
```graphql
query DeviceQuery {
  NetworkDevice {
    edges {
      node {
        name {
          value
        }
        description {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response to the query:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "NetworkDevice": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": {
              "value": "switch1"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch1"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": {
              "value": "switch2"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch2"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": {
              "value": "switch3"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch3"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Converted query response">
    Here we must provide `__typename` and `id` within the query so the SDK can convert the query to the correct type and properly store within the SDK.

```graphql
query DeviceQuery {
  NetworkDevice {
    edges {
      node {
        __typename
        id
        name {
          value
        }
        description {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response to the query:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "NetworkDevice": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "__typename": "NetworkDevice",
            "id": "18429816-0726-6abc-2d6e-c51223f5f000",
            "name": {
              "value": "switch3"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch1"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "__typename": "NetworkDevice",
            "id": "18429817-4aa2-920a-2d6b-c51b4e66e20b",
            "name": {
              "value": "switch1"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch1"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "__typename": "NetworkDevice",
            "id": "18429818-2756-a07a-2d63-c51b5d41c28f",
            "name": {
              "value": "switch2"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch1"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

While it would be possible to create a transform that targets all of these devices, for example if you want to create a report, the goal for us is to be able to focus on one of these objects. For this reason we need to modify the query from above to take an input parameter so that we can filter the result to what we want.

Create a local directory on your computer.

```shell
mkdir device_config_render
```

Then save the above query as a text file named `device_config_render/device_config.gql`.

The query will require an input parameter called `$name` what will refer to the name of each device. When we want to query for device switch1, the input variables to the query would look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "switch1"
}
```

## 3. Create the Python transform file

The next step is to create the actual Python transform. The transform is a Python class that inherits from InfrahubTransform from the [Python SDK]($(base_url)python-sdk/introduction). Create a file called `device_config_render/device_config.py`:

<Tabs groupId="convertResponse">
  <TabItem value="Non-converted query response">
```python
    <!-- vale Infrahub.spelling = NO -->
from infrahub_sdk.transforms import InfrahubTransform
class DeviceConfigTransform(InfrahubTransform):
    query = "device_config_query"
    async def transform(self, data):
        device = data["NetworkDevice"]["edges"][0]["node"]
        device_name = device["name"]["value"]
        device_description = device["description"]["value"]
        return {
            "device_hostname": device_name,
            "device_description": f"*{device_description}*"
        }
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Converted query response">
```python
from infrahub_sdk.transforms import InfrahubTransform
class DeviceConfigTransform(InfrahubTransform):
    query = "device_config_query"
    async def transform(self, data):
        device = self.nodes[0]
        device_name = device.name.value
        device_description = device.description.value
        return {
            "device_hostname": device_name,
            "device_description": f"*{device_description}*",
        }
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The example is simplistic in terms of what we do with the data, but all of the important parts of a Transform exist here.

1. We import the InfrahubTransform class.

```python
from infrahub_sdk.transforms import InfrahubTransform
```

2. We define our own class based on InfrahubTransform.

```python
class DeviceConfigTransform(InfrahubTransform):
```

Here we need to note the name of the class as we will need it later, optionally we can just call it `Transform` which is the default name.

3. We define where data comes from and what API endpoint to use.

```python
    query = "device_config_query"
```

The query part refers to the the query that we will define in the `.infrahub.yml` repository configuration file later in the guide.

With this configuration, the endpoint of our transform will be [http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python/device_config_transform](http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python/device_config_transform).

4. The Transform method

<Tabs groupId="convertResponse">
  <TabItem value="Non-converted query response">
    <!-- vale Infrahub.spelling = NO -->
```python
async def transform(self, data):
    device = data["BuiltinTag"]["edges"][0]["node"]
    device_name = device["name"]["value"]
    device_description = device["description"]["value"]
    return {
        "device_hostname": device_name,
        "device_description": f"*{device_description}*"
    }
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Converted query response">
    <!-- vale Infrahub.spelling = NO -->
```python
async def transform(self, data):
    device = self.nodes[0]
    device_name = device.name.value
    device_description = device.description.value
    return {
        "device_hostname": device_name,
        "device_description": f"*{device_description}*",
    }
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When running the transform, the `data` input variable will consist of the response to the query we created or the webhook payload if using the transform with a [Custom Webhook](../topics/webhooks.mdx).

In this case, the transform returns a JSON object consisting of two keys `device_hostname` and `device_description` where we have modified the data in some way. Here you would return data in the format you need.

:::info

If you are unsure of the format of the data you can set a debug marker when testing the Transform with infrahubctl:

```python
    async def transform(self, data):
        breakpoint()
        device = data["BuiltinTag"]["edges"][0]["node"]
        device_name = device["name"]["value"]
        device_description = device["description"]["value"]
```

:::

## 4. Create an .infrahub.yml file

The [.infrahub.yml](../topics/infrahub-yml.mdx) file allows you to define both the transform and query.

:::info Convert query to Infrahub SDK objects
We provide `convert_query_response` option to be toggled to be able to access objects from the GraphQL query as Infrahub SDK objects rather than the raw dictionary response.

This allows you to manage the returned data with helper methods on the SDK objects such as `save`, `fetch`, etc. on the returned data rather than having to build a payload to send back to Infrahub to manage the objects.

Read more on the [Infrahub Python SDK]($(base_url)python-sdk/introduction).
:::

See [this topic](../topics/infrahub-yml.mdx) for a full explanation of everything that can be defined in the `.infrahub.yml` file.

<Tabs groupId="convertResponse">
  <TabItem value="Non-converted query response">
    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
    <!-- vale Infrahub.swap = NO -->
    <!-- vale Infrahub.spelling = NO -->
```yaml title=".infrahub.yml"
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.infrahub.app/python-sdk/repository-config/latest.json
---
python_transforms:
  - name: device_config_transform
    class_name: DeviceConfigTransform
    file_path: "device_config_render/device_config.py"
queries:
  - name: device_config_query
      file_path: "device_config_render/device_config.gql"
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Converted query response">
    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
    <!-- vale Infrahub.swap = NO -->
```yaml title=".infrahub.yml"
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.infrahub.app/python-sdk/repository-config/latest.json
---
python_transforms:
  - name: device_config_transform
    class_name: DeviceConfigTransform
    convert_query_response: true
    file_path: "device_config_render/device_config.py"
queries:
  - name: device_config_query
      file_path: "device_config_render/device_config.gql"
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Python transform" default>
    Two parts here are required, first the `name` of the Transform which should be unique across Infrahub and also the `file_path` that should point to the Python file within the repository. In this example we have also defined `class_name`, the reason for this is that we gave our class the name `DeviceConfigTransform` instead of the default `Transform`.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Queries">
    Here the `name` refers to the query's name and `file_path` should point to the GraphQL file within the repository.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

See [this topic](../topics/infrahub-yml.mdx) for a full explanation of everything that can be defined in the `.infrahub.yml` file.

## 5. Test the Transform using infrahubctl

Using infrahubctl you can first verify that the `.infrahub.yml` file is formatted correctly by listing available transforms.

```shell title="❯ infrahubctl transform --list"
Python transforms defined in repository: 1
device_config_transform (device_config.py::DeviceConfigTransform)
```

:::info
Trying to run the transform with just the transform name will produce an error.

```shell title="❯ infrahubctl transform device_config_transform"
{'message': "Variable '$name' of required type 'String!' was not provided.", 'locations': [{'line': 1, 'column': 19}]}
```

Here we can see that our query is missing the required input for `$name` which is needed to filter the data.

:::

Run the Transform and specify the variable name along with the tag we want to target.

```json title="❯ infrahubctl transform device_config_transform name=switch2"
{
  "device_description": "*This is device switch2*",
  "device_hostname": "switch2"
}
```

We have now successfully created a transform. Most of the transforms you will create would be more complex than this, however the main building blocks will always remain the same. It could be that you need the output in OpenConfig format, as Terraform input variables or any other kind of format.

## 6. Create a Git repository

Within the `device_config_render` folder you should now have 3 files:

* `device_config_render/device_config.gql`: Contains the GraphQL query
* `device_config_render/device_config.py`: Contains the Python code for the transform
* `.infrahub.yml`: Contains the definition for the transform

Before we can test our transform we must add the files to a local Git repository.

```shell
git init --initial-branch=main
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
```

## 7. Adding the repository to Infrahub

In order to avoid having the same instructions over and over please refer to the guide [adding a repository to Infrahub](../guides/repository.mdx) in order to sync the repository you created and make it available within Infrahub.

## 8. Accessing the transform from the API

Once the repository is synced to Infrahub you can access the Transform from the API:

```json title="❯ curl http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python/device_config_transform?name=switch2"
{
  "device_hostname":"switch2",
  "device_description":"*This is device switch2*"
}
```

```json title="❯ curl http://localhost:8000/api/transform/python/device_config_transform?name=switch3"
{
  "device_hostname":"switch3",
  "device_description":"*This is device switch3*"
}
```
