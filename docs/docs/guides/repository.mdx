# How to connect external Git repositories

Connecting an external Git repository will enable many features in Infrahub, such as Transformations, Generators, Checks ... that rely on the repository to store code files.

This guide explains how to connect repositories, pull changes, and troubleshoot common issues.

:::info Repository vs. Read-only Repository

If you want to know more about the differences between these two types, refer to the topic on [Repositories](../topics/repository).

**TL;DR:**

- **Repository**: fully integrates with Git version control, including branch tracking and two-way branch synchronization
- **Read-only Repository**: links a particular branch in Infrahub to a particular ref in the Git repository. It will only read from the Git repository and never make changes to the external repository.

Most of the time, you will want to use a **Repository** connection.

:::

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need:

- An Infrahub instance up and running
- Access to a Git repository containing valid Infrahub resources (see [Repository Init]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-repository))
  - A [`.infrahub.yml`](../topics/repository#infrahub-yaml) configuration file in your Git repository
- For private repositories and or Read-Write repositories: appropriate credentials or access tokens
- Depending on the method you choose, you may need to install the [Infrahub SDK]($(base_url)python-sdk/introduction) or [infrahubctl]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl)

:::info Authentication for repositories

If your repository is private or if you want to set up a Read-Write Repository, you'll need to create an access token for authentication.

Depending on your Git provider, the process may vary:

- For GitHub repositories, see the [GitHub access token guide](#github-access-token).
- For GitLab repositories, see the [GitLab access token guide](#gitlab-access-token).

:::

## Connect a repository

### Step 1: Collect repository information

To create a repository connection in Infrahub, you'll need to prepare the following information:

- **Name:** The identifier you wish to assign to the repository in Infrahub (for example, `My Git Repository`)
- **Repository location:** The URL of the external Git repository (for example, `https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub.git`)

For Read-only repositories, you will also need:

- **Ref:** A branch, tag, or commit reference to pull (for example, `main`, `v1.0`, or a specific commit hash)

For private repositories and/or Read-Write repositories:

- **Authentication:** A username/password combination or personal access token

### Step 2: Add the repository

:::warning Access token configuration

If you are using a **personal access token for authentication**, you should put the token in the `password` field of the credential and leave the `username` field empty.

<TabItem value="Via infrahubctl">
  Using the [infrahubctl]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl) command-line tool, you can add a repository by running the following command:

  <Tabs groupId="repository-type">
    <TabItem value="Repository" default>
    ```shell
    infrahubctl repository add "My Git Repository" "https://GIT_SERVER/YOUR_GIT_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git" --username MY_USERNAME --password MY_TOKEN_OR_PASSWORD
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Read-only Repository">
    ```shell
    infrahubctl repository add "My Git Repository" "https://GIT_SERVER/YOUR_GIT_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git" --read-only --username MY_USERNAME --password MY_TOKEN_OR_PASSWORD
    ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Via the GraphQL Interface">

  Using the GraphQL API, you can add a `Repository` or `Read-only Repository` via mutations.

  1. Open the **GraphQL Interface**

  :::note GraphQL Sandbox

  Access the sandbox by clicking your user icon in the bottom left corner and selecting **GraphQL Sandbox**.

  :::

  2. If relevant, create a Credential object with your username and password/token:

  ```graphql
  mutation {
    CorePasswordCredentialCreate(
      data: {
        name: { value: "my-git-credential" },
        username: { value: "MY_USERNAME" },
        password: { value: "MY_TOKEN_OR_PASSWORD" }
      }
    ) {
      ok
      object {
        hfid
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  3. Use one of the mutations below based on your repository type:

  <Tabs groupId="repository-type">
    <TabItem value="Repository" default>
    ```graphql
    mutation {
      CoreRepositoryCreate(
        data: {

          ref: { value: "BRANCH/TAG/COMMIT_TO_TRACK" },
          # Optional: use the credential created earlier
          credential: { hfid: ["my-git-credential"] }
        }
      ) {
        ok
        object {
          id
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Via the Infrahub SDK">
  1. If relevant, create a Credential object with your username and password/token:

  ```python
  # Create credential object
  credential = client.create(

      name="My Git Credential",
      username="MY_USERNAME",
      password="MY_TOKEN_OR_PASSWORD",
  )
  credential.save()
  ```

  2. Create the repository object:

  <Tabs groupId="repository-type">
    <TabItem value="Repository" default>
    ```python
    # Create repository object
    repository = client.create(
        "CoreRepository",
        name="My Git repository",
        location="https://GIT_SERVER/YOUR_GIT_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git",
        credential=credential,  # The credential object created above
    )
    repository.save()
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Read-only Repository">
    ```python
    # Create repository object
    repository = client.create(
        "CoreReadOnlyRepository",
        name="My Git repository",

    )
    repository.save()
    ```
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success Check repository connectivity

After creation, your new repository should appear under **Integrations > Git Repositories**. If the status shows `Unknown` or an error state, please refer to the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshoot-repository-connections).

:::

## Advanced use cases

### Update a read-only repository with remote changes

Unlike fully integrated repositories which sync automatically, read-only repositories must be manually updated by changing the `ref` value when you want to pull in new changes.

For more details on how each repository type tracks changes, refer to the [Repository Topic](../topics/repository#read-only-vs-core).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Via the Web Interface" default>

1. Log in to the Infrahub UI
2. Go to **Integrations > Git Repositories**
3. Click on the `CoreReadOnlyRepository` record you want to update
4. Click on the **Edit Read-Only Repository** button
5. Update the `ref` field with the new branch, tag, or commit reference to pull
6. Click **Save** to apply the changes

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Via the GraphQL Interface">

1. Open the **GraphQL Interface**

:::note GraphQL Sandbox

Access the sandbox by clicking your user icon in the bottom left corner and selecting **GraphQL Sandbox**.

:::

2. Execute the update mutation with the new ref value:

```graphql
mutation {
  CoreReadOnlyRepositoryUpdate(
    data: {
      hfid: ["My Git repository"],
      ref: { value: "BRANCH/TAG/COMMIT_TO_TRACK" }
    }
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
      syncStatus
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success Check synchronization status

After updating the ref, the repository will begin synchronizing. You can monitor the process by checking the repository's sync status, which should change to `Syncing` and then to `In sync` when complete. The commit field will also update to reflect the latest commit from the specified ref.

:::

### Troubleshoot repository connections

If you encounter issues with your repository connections, you can use the following steps to diagnose and resolve them:

1. Check the repository status indicators:
   - **Admin status**: Indicates if Infrahub is actively using the repository
   - **Operational status**: Shows connectivity between Infrahub and the repository
   - **Sync status**: Tracks synchronization operations

   For detailed information about what each status means, refer to the [Repository Status documentation](../topics/repository#repository-statuses).

2. View detailed operation logs:
   - Log in to the Infrahub UI
   - Go to **Integrations > Git Repositories**
   - Select the relevant repository record
   - Click on the **Tasks** tab to view detailed logs of Git operations

3. Use repository actions for advanced troubleshooting:
   - From the repository detail view, click the **More** menu
   - Select **Check connectivity** to verify authentication and connection
   - Select **Reimport last commit** to force reimport without changing the reference

:::success Validation
A healthy repository connection should show `Online` for operational status and `In sync` for sync status once all operations complete.
:::

### GitHub access token

Please refer to the official GitHub documentation for creating access tokens. GitHub offers two types of tokens:

- [Personal Access Token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
- [Fine-grained Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)

:::info Personal Access Token vs. Fine-grained Access Token

For new repositories, we recommend using the **Fine-grained Access Token** as it allows more granular control over permissions.

:::

Grant the token permission:

- For a `Repository`, grant **Read/Write** access to the repository content
- For a `Read-only Repository`, grant **Read** access only

:::success Token created

Now that you have created your token, you can use it to connect your GitHub repository to Infrahub. In this case, you will need to put the token in the `password` field of the credential and leave the `username` field empty.

:::

### GitLab access token

Please refer to the official GitLab documentation for creating access tokens.

:::info Project Access Tokens

We recommend using a [project access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens/) which has the advantage of being scoped to a specific project.

:::

:::warning Security best practice

While personal access tokens or username/password authentication might work depending on your setup, we strongly recommend against using them as they are scoped to user accounts rather than specific repositories.

:::

Grant the token permission:

- For a `Repository`, select both `read_repository` and `write_repository` scopes
- For a `Read-only Repository`, select the `read_repository` scope

:::success Token created

Now that you have created your token, you can use it to connect your GitLab repository to Infrahub. In this case, you will need to put the token in the `password` field of the credential and leave the `username` field empty.

:::

### Installing custom CA certificates

If your Git server uses a certificate signed by a custom Certificate Authority (CA) not recognized by default, you'll need to add your CA certificate to the Infrahub container.

:::warning Maintenance consideration

This process requires building a custom Docker image, which you'll need to rebuild with each Infrahub release.

:::

Follow these steps to add your custom CA certificate:

1. Save your CA certificate (and any intermediate certificates) in PEM format (such as `mycacertificate.crt`)
2. Create a Dockerfile in the same directory as your certificate:

```dockerfile
ARG INFRAHUB_VERSION=latest
FROM registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/infrahub:${INFRAHUB_VERSION}

COPY mycacertificate.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
RUN update-ca-certificates
```

3. Build the Docker image:

```shell
INFRAHUB_VERSION=latest && docker build --build-arg INFRAHUB_VERSION=$INFRAHUB_VERSION -f Dockerfile -t custom/infrahub:${INFRAHUB_VERSION} .
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using Docker Compose" default>

If you are using Docker Compose, you can override part of your existing `docker-compose.yml` file to use your custom image. See the official [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge/#how-to-merge-multiple-compose-files) for more details.

4. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
---
services:
  task-worker:
    image: custom/infrahub:latest
```

5. Start your environment using the `docker compose` command.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success Validation

After restarting your environment, Infrahub should now trust your custom CA and be able to connect to Git servers using certificates signed by it.

:::

### Disabling certificate verification (not recommended)

:::danger Security risk

Disabling certificate validation is a bad security practice and is strongly discouraged. Only use this option in controlled development environments.

:::

:::warning Custom Docker Image

This process requires building a custom Docker image, which you'll need to rebuild with each Infrahub release.

:::

If you absolutely need to disable certificate verification for testing purposes:

1. Create a Dockerfile with the following content:

```dockerfile
ARG INFRAHUB_VERSION=latest
FROM registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/infrahub:${INFRAHUB_VERSION}

RUN git config --global http.sslVerify "false"
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```shell
INFRAHUB_VERSION=latest && docker build --build-arg INFRAHUB_VERSION=$INFRAHUB_VERSION -f Dockerfile -t custom/infrahub:${INFRAHUB_VERSION} .
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using Docker Compose" default>

If you are using Docker Compose, you can override part of your existing `docker-compose.yml` file to use your custom image. See the official [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge/#how-to-merge-multiple-compose-files) for more details.

3. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
---
services:
  task-worker:
    image: custom/infrahub:latest
```

4. Start your environment using the `docker compose` command.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success Validation

After restarting your environment, Infrahub should now connect to Git servers without validating SSL certificates.

:::

### Using a proxy server

In some network environments, Infrahub's Git worker containers may need to connect through a proxy server to access external repositories.

:::info Connection limitation

This method only works for HTTP(S) connections. SSH connections through proxies are not supported in this configuration.

:::

:::warning Maintenance consideration

This process requires building a custom Docker image, which you'll need to rebuild with each Infrahub release.

:::

1. Create a Dockerfile with your proxy configuration (update with your actual proxy details):

```dockerfile
ARG INFRAHUB_VERSION=latest
FROM registry.opsmill.io/opsmill/infrahub:${INFRAHUB_VERSION}

RUN git config --global http.proxy http://user:password@internal.proxy:8080
```

2. Build the Docker image:

```shell
INFRAHUB_VERSION=latest && docker build --build-arg INFRAHUB_VERSION=$INFRAHUB_VERSION -f Dockerfile -t custom/infrahub:${INFRAHUB_VERSION} .
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Using Docker Compose" default>

If you are using Docker Compose, you can override part of your existing `docker-compose.yml` file to use your custom image. See the official [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/multiple-compose-files/merge/#how-to-merge-multiple-compose-files) for more details.

3. Create a `docker-compose.override.yml` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
---
services:
  task-worker:
    image: custom/infrahub:latest
```

4. Start your environment using the `docker compose` command.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::success Validation

After restarting your environment, Infrahub should now connect through your configured proxy server.

:::

## Verification

After completing this guide, you should have successfully connected external Git repositories to Infrahub.

You can verify your repository integration is working by checking that:

- The repository shows an "Online" operational status
- The repository shows an "In sync" sync status
- Branches from your repository appear in Infrahub (for fully integrated repositories)
- Resources defined in your `.infrahub.yml` file are accessible in Infrahub
