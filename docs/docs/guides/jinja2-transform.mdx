title: Creating a Jinja transform

# Creating a Jinja rendered file (transform)

Within Infrahub a [Transform](../topics/transformation) is defined in an [external repository](../topics/repository). However, during development and troubleshooting it is easiest to start from your local computer and run the render using [infrahubctl render]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-render).

The goal of this guide is to develop a Jinja Transform and add it to Infrahub, we will achieve this by following these steps.

1. Identify the relevant data you want to extract from the database using a [GraphQL query](../topics/graphql), that can take an input parameter to filter the data
2. Write a Jinja2 file that use the GraphQL query to read information from the system and render the data into a new format
3. Create an entry for the Jinja2 Transform within an .infrahub.yml file.
4. Create a Git repository
5. Test the Transform rendering with infrahubctl
6. Add the repository to Infrahub as an external repository
7. Validate that the Transform works by using the render API endpoint

## 1. Loading a schema

In this guide we are going to work with a very simplistic network device model. I won't provide a rendered template that is very useful, the goal is instead to show how the Jinja Rendering works. Once you have mastered the basics you will be ready to go on to create more advanced template.

```yaml
---
version: "1.0"
nodes:
  - name: Device
    namespace: Network
    display_labels:
      - name__value
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        label: Name
        optional: false
        unique: true
      - name: description
        kind: Text
        label: Description
        optional: true
```

Store the schema as a YAML file on your local disk, and load the schema into Infrahub using the following command

```bash
infrahubctl schema load /path/to/schema.yml
```

More information on loading schema files into Infrahub can be found [here](../guides/import-schema#load-a-schema-file).

## 2. Creating a query to collect the desired data

As the first step we need to have some data in the database to actually query.

Create three devices, called "switch1", "switch2", "switch3", either using the frontend or by submitting three GraphQL mutations as per below (just swapping out the name of the color each time).

```graphql
mutation CreateDevice {
  NetworkDeviceCreate(
    data: {name: {value: "switch1"}, description: {value: "This is device switch1"}}
  ) {
    ok
    object {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

The next step is to create a query that returns the data we just created. The rest of this guide assumes that the following query will return a response similar to the response below the query.

```graphql
query DeviceQuery {
  NetworkDevice {
    edges {
      node {
        name {
          value
        }
        description {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Response to the tags query:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "NetworkDevice": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": {
              "value": "switch1"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch1"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": {
              "value": "switch2"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch2"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": {
              "value": "switch3"
            },
            "description": {
              "value": "This is device switch3"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

While it would be possible to create a Transform that targets all of these devices, for example if you want to create a report, the goal for us is to be able to focus on one of these objects. For this reason we need to modify the query from above to take an input parameter so that we can filter the result to what we want.

Create a local directory on your computer.

```shell
mkdir device_config_render
```

Then save the below query as a text file named `device_config.gql`.

```graphql
query DeviceQuery($name: String!) {
  NetworkDevice(name__value: $name) {
    edges {
      node {
        name {
          value
        }
        description {
          value
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here the query will require an input parameter called `$name` what will refer to the name of each device. When we want to query for device switch1, the input variables to the query would look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "switch1"
}
```

## 3. Create the Jinja template

The next step is to create the actual Jinja Template file. Create a file called `device_config.j2`.

```jinja2
{% if data.NetworkDevice.edges and data.NetworkDevice.edges is iterable %}
{% for device in data["NetworkDevice"]["edges"] %}
{% set device_name = device.node.name.value %}
{% set device_description = device.node.description.value %}
hostname {{ device_name }}
   description "{{ device_description }}"
end
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

:::note

In your template, you can utilize most of the **filters** provided by **Jinja2** and **Netutils**!

For more information, please consult the [SDK Templating Reference]($(base_url)python-sdk/reference/templating).

:::

## 4. Create a .infrahub.yml file

In the .infrahub.yml file you define what transforms you have in your repository that you want to make available for Infrahub.

Create a .infrahub.yml file in the root of the directory.

```yaml
---
jinja2_transforms:
  - name: device_config_transform             # Unique name for your transform
    description: "device config transform"    # (optional)
    query: "device_config_query"              # Name or ID of the GraphQLQuery
    template_path: "device_config.j2"         # Path to the main Jinja2 template

queries:
  - name: device_config_query                 # Name of the GraphQLQuery
    file_path: "device_config.gql"            # Path to the main Jinja2 template
```

> The main Jinja2 template can import other templates

Three parts here are required, first the `name` of the Transform which should be unique across Infrahub, `query` the GraphqlQuery linked to our Transform and also the `template_path` that should point to the Jinja2 file within the repository.

## 5. Create a Git repository

Within the `device_config_render` folder you should now have tree files:

* device_config.gql: Contains the GraphQL query
* device_config.j2: Contains the Jinja2 Template
* .infrahub.yml: Contains the definition for the transform

Before we can test our Transform we must add the files to a local Git repository.

```shell
git init --initial-branch=main
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"
```

## 6. Test the render using infrahubctl

Using infrahubctl you can first verify that the `.infrahub.yml` file is formatted correctly by listing available transforms.

```shell

 Usage: infrahubctl render [OPTIONS] TRANSFORM_NAME [VARIABLES]...

 Render a local Jinja2 Transform for debugging purpose.

╭─ Arguments ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ *    transform_name      TEXT            [default: None] [required]                             │
│      variables           [VARIABLES]...  Variables to pass along with the query. Format         │
│                                          key=value key=value.                                   │
│                                          [default: None]                                        │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
╭─ Options ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ --branch                       TEXT  Branch on which to render the transform. [default: None]   │
│ --debug          --no-debug          [default: no-debug]                                        │
│ --config-file                  TEXT  [env var: INFRAHUBCTL_CONFIG] [default: infrahubctl.toml]  │
│ --help                               Show this message and exit.                                │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Examples

```shell
infrahubctl render <transform name or ID> my-param=XXXXX my-other-param=YYYYY
```

:::note

If `--branch` is not provided it will automatically use the name of the local branch.

## 7. Adding the repository to Infrahub

In order to avoid having the same instructions over and over please refer to the guide [adding a repository to Infrahub](../guides/repository) in order to sync the repository you created and make it available within Infrahub.

## 8. Accessing the Transform from the API

A Transform can be rendered on demand via the REST API with the endpoint: `https://<host>/api/transform/jinja2/<transform name or ID>`

This endpoint is branch-aware and it accepts the name of the branch and/or the time as URL parameters.

* `https://<host>/api/transform/jinja2/<transform name or ID>?branch=main`
* `https://<host>/api/transform/jinja2/<transform name or ID>?branch=main&at=<time of your choice>`

:::info

The name of the branch used in the query will be used to retrieve the right Jinja template and to execute the GraphQL query.

:::

If the GraphQL query accepts parameters, they can be passed directly as URL parameters:

```txt
https://<host>/api/transform/jinja2/<transform name or ID>?branch=main&my-param=XXX&my-other-param=YYY
```
