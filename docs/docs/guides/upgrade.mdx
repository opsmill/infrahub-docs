The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version will vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub. However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version and performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

For installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](./installation).

Follow the instructions below for your current release version and deployment method.

:::info
Even though a "smooth" migration is anticipated, we nonetheless strongly suggest creating a backup beforehand. For detailed information, see our [Backup Guide](./database-backup).
:::

:::info
In Infrahub 1.2 and later, the upgrade process has been streamlined with a unified upgrade command.
For earlier versions, please refer to the [release notes](/release-notes/infrahub) for specific upgrade instructions.

### Upgrading to Infrahub 1.2 and after

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

```bash
# Stop the current instance
docker compose down

# Retrieve the latest docker-compose version
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io > docker-compose.yml

# Run the unified upgrade command
docker compose run infrahub-server infrahub upgrade

# Restart the instance
docker compose up -d
```

:::note

Old Docker images of Infrahub may remain on your machine and consume disk space after an upgrade. To free up space and keep disk usage under control, consider removing unused images.

You can do this with: `docker image prune -a`
