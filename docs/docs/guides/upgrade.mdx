The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version will vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub. However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version and performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

For installation instructions, please refer to our [Installation Guide](./installation).

Follow the instructions below for your current release version and deployment method.

:::info
Even though a "smooth" migration is anticipated, we nonetheless strongly suggest creating a backup beforehand. For detailed information, see our [Backup Guide](./database-backup).

### Upgrading to Infrahub 1.1 and before

For versions **1.1** and earlier, perform the manual upgrade steps:

```bash
# Download the desired release
curl -L -o infrahub.tar.gz https://github.com/infrahub/infrahub/releases/download/v1.1/infrahub-1.1.tar.gz
tar -xzf infrahub.tar.gz

# Stop the current instance
invoke demo.stop

# Replace the binary and run migrations
cp infrahub-1.1/infrahub /usr/local/bin/infrahub
invoke demo.migrate

# Restart the instance
invoke demo.start
```

### Upgrading to Infrahub 1.2 and after

In version 1.2 the upgrade process has been streamlined with a unified upgrade command:

```bash
inv upgrade
```

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

```bash
# Stop the current instance
invoke demo.stop

# Rebuild and run migrations
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate

# Restart the instance
invoke demo.start
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="helm" label="Helm">
<!-- vale off -->

```bash
# Add or update Helm repository
helm repo add infrahub https://charts.infrahub.com
helm repo update

# Upgrade the release
helm upgrade infrahub infrahub/infrahub
```

<!-- vale on -->
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="devdemo" label="Dev/Demo">

```bash
# Stop the current instance
invoke demo.stop

# Rebuild and run migrations
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate

# Restart the instance
invoke demo.start
```
