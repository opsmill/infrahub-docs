# Creating a Group in Infrahub
<!-- vale on -->

Within Infrahub a [Group](../topics/groups) can be created in multiple ways: in the UI, GraphQL, SDK and allow you to create and manage collections of objects.

As the first step we need to create a group.
We will be adding the `red` and `blue` tag to the `TagConfigGroup` group that we created in the previous step.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Via the Web Interface" default>
  ## Via the Web Interface

  In the web interface navigate to Object Management > Groups  in the menu on the left.

  As the first step we need to create a group.
  ![New Group](../media/group_tagconfig_grp_new_grp.png)

  Then we will add members to the group.

  <TabItem value="Via the GraphQL Interface">
  ## Via the GraphQL Interface

  1. Open the [GraphQL Interface](http://localhost:8000/graphql).
  2. Execute this GraphQL mutation to create the group `TagConfigGroup`.

  ```graphql
  mutation CreateGroup {
    CoreStandardGroupCreate (data: {name: {value: "TagConfigGroup"}}) {
      ok
      object {
        hfid
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Take note of the returned `HFID`, we will need it when we add members to this group.

  3. Adding members to the group

  We will be adding the `red` and `blue` tag to the `TagConfigGroup` group that we created in the previous step.

  We need to retrieve the ids of the `red` and `blue` tag. Execute the following GraphQL query and take note of the ids.

  ```graphql
  query {
    BuiltinTag (name__values: ["red","blue"]) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          display_label
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Next, we will be adding the tag nodes to the group. We will use the following GraphQL mutation.
  In the mutation, replace the `IDs` with the ones from the tags retrieved in the previous step

  ```graphql
  mutation UpdateGroupMembers {
    CoreStandardGroupUpdate (
      data: {
        hfid: ["TagConfigGroup"],
        members: [
          {id: "<id of red tag>"},
          {id: "<id of blue tag>"}]}
    ) {
      ok
    }
  }
  ```

  The resulting mutation should look like this (note that the ids will be different in your case).

  ```graphql
  mutation UpdateGroupMembers {
    CoreStandardGroupUpdate(
      data: {
        hfid: ["TagConfigGroup"],
        members: [
          {id: "17a8f438-fe39-d85f-3c3b-c51d66d0603f"},
          {id: "17a8f437-157a-e023-3c3c-c51f788ddf91"}]}
    ) {
      ok
    }
  }
  ```

  :::success Validate that everything is correct

  In the web interface navigate to Object Management > Groups  in the menu on the left.
  Select the `TagConfigGroup` and navigate to the Members tab. We can confirm that the `red` and `blue` tag are now a member of the group.
