title: Importing Objects from a file

# Object files

An Object file is a YAML file that allows you to manage data to be loaded in Infrahub based on your own custom schema. It provides a declarative way to define and manage resources in your Infrahub instance.

Object files work well for models that don't change too often and/or that need to be tracked in Git. Examples include: Groups, tags, Users, etc.

The goal of this guide is to show you how you define and load an object file.

## Loading an example schema into Infrahub

We assume that you have an empty instance of Infrahub started.

Save the following schema into a file on your disk.

The schema contains the following nodes:

- A location hierarchy with a Country and a Site
- A network device with a relation to network interfaces and a site
- A network interface with a relation to a network device

```yaml
---
version: "1.0"
generics:
  - name: Generic
    namespace: Location
    include_in_menu: false
    hierarchical: true
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        optional: false
        unique: true
nodes:
  - name: Country
    namespace: Location
    inherit_from:
      - LocationGeneric
    parent: ""
    children: LocationSite
  - name: Site
    namespace: Location
    inherit_from:
      - LocationGeneric
    parent: LocationCountry
    children: ""
    relationships:
      - name: devices
        kind: Generic
        peer: NetworkDevice
        cardinality: many
        optional: true
  - name: Device
    namespace: Network
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        optional: false
        unique: true
    relationships:
      - name: site
        kind: Attribute
        cardinality: one
        optional: true
        peer: LocationSite
      - name: interfaces
        kind: Component
        cardinality: many
        optional: true
        peer: NetworkInterface
  - name: Interface
    namespace: Network
    attributes:
      - name: name
        kind: Text
        optional: false
    relationships:
      - name: device
        kind: Parent
        optional: false
        cardinality: one
        peer: NetworkDevice
```

Load the schema into Infrahub using the following command

```bash
infrahubctl schema load /path/to/schema.yml
```

In the web interface you will now see that all the nodes defined in the schema are available in the top section of the menu.

## Defining a object file

Our goal is to define data that can be loaded into Infrahub based on the schema we just defined. We will create an object file that defines a Country and a Site.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: LocationCountry
  data:
    - name: United Kingdom
      children:
        kind: LocationSite
        data:
          - name: Stonehenge Visitor Centre
          - name: Tower of London
          - name: Edinburgh Castle
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: NetworkDevice
  data:
    - name: sw01-svc01
      site: Stonehenge Visitor Centre
---
apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Object
spec:
  kind: NetworkInterface
  data:
    - name: eth0
      device: sw01-svc01
    - name: eth1
      device: sw01-svc01
    - name: eth2
      device: sw01-svc01
    - name: eth3
      device: sw01-svc01
    - name: eth4
      device: sw01-svc01
    - name: eth5
      device: sw01-svc01
```

> Note that these definitions can be in separate files but for simplicity we have put them all in one file using `---` to separate the different objects.

For a more detailed information on the structure and relationship management within an object file, visit the [SDK Object File]($(base_url)python-sdk/topics/object_file) docs.

## Loading a object file

You can load the object files into Infrahub using `object` subcommand of the `infrahubctl` utility.

Load the objects into Infrahub using the following command

```bash
infrahubctl object load /path/to/objects.yml
```

More information on `infrahubctl` command line utility can be found [here]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl).
More information on the `object` subcommand can be found [here]($(base_url)infrahubctl/infrahubctl-object).

Objects can also be loaded into Infrahub using the git repository integration. To do this, you need to add the object file to the `.infrahub.yml` details can be seen in the [.infrahub.yml](../topics/infrahub-yml) documentation.

:::info

Loading objects using git or via the command line will load folders/files in alphabetical order.
