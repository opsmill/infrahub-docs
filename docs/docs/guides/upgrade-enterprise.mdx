title: Upgrade Infrahub Enterprise
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version will vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

For installation instructions, please refer to our [Enterprise Installation Guide](./installation-enterprise).

Follow the instructions below for your current release version and deployment method.

:::info
Even though a "smooth" migration is anticipated, we nonetheless strongly suggest creating a backup beforehand.
For detailed information, see our [Backup Guide](./database-backup).

## Upgrading to Infrahub 1.2 and after

In version 1.2 the upgrade process has been streamlined with a unified upgrade command:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>
    ```bash

    # Bring down the current environment
    docker compose down

    # Pull the new docker-compose file
    curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/enterprise > docker-compose.yml

    # Run the unified upgrade command
    docker compose run infrahub-server infrahub upgrade

    # Bring the environment back up
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="helm" label="Helm">
    ```bash
    # Upgrade the Helm release
    helm upgrade

    # Run the unified upgrade command inside the server pod
    kubectl exec infrahub-infrahub-server-xxxxxx -- infrahub upgrade

    # Restart deployments to apply changes
    kubectl rollout restart deployment/prefect-server
    kubectl rollout restart deployment/infrahub-infrahub-server
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="devdemo" label="Dev/Demo">
    ```bash
    # Stop the current instance
    invoke demo.stop

    # Rebuild and run the unified upgrade command
    invoke demo.build
    invoke demo.migrate

    # Restart the instance
    invoke demo.start
    ```

    Or for a clean instance (warning: all data will be lost):

    ```bash
    invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If the core schema is reported to have been modified during the upgrade process it's strongly recommended to rebase any open branches once the system is online again.

## Upgrading to Infrahub 1.1 and before

    # Run database migrations and schema update
    docker compose run infrahub-server infrahub db migrate
    docker compose run infrahub-server infrahub db update-core-schema

    # Bring the environment back up
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="helm" label="Helm">
