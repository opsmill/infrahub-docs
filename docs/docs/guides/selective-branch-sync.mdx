# Configure selective branch synchronization

This guide walks you through setting up branch name filtering rules to control which Git branches are imported and synchronized into Infrahub. Use this when your Git repository contains many branches unrelated to infrastructure management, and you want to reduce noise in your Infrahub branch list.

For background on how selective branch synchronization works, see [Selective branch synchronization](../topics/branch-synchronization.mdx).

## Prerequisites

Before configuring selective branch synchronization, ensure you have:

- Access to your Infrahub configuration file (`infrahub.toml`) or environment variables
- Ability to restart Infrahub services

:::info Understanding selective synchronization

To learn more about how selective branch synchronization works, see the [Selective branch synchronization topic](../topics/branch-synchronization.mdx).

:::

## Step 1: Define your branch naming rules

Decide which Git branches should be imported into Infrahub. Branch naming rules use regular expressions to match branch names.

Common patterns:

- All infrastructure-related branches: `^infra/.*$`
- Team-specific prefixes: `^(infra|network|config)/.*$`
- Feature branches with issue numbers: `^feature/infrahub-[0-9]+.*$`
- Specific branch names: `^(main|production|staging)$`

See the [Regular expression patterns](../topics/branch-synchronization.mdx#regular-expression-patterns) section for more examples.

## Step 2: Configure the synchronization rules

You can configure selective branch synchronization using either a configuration file or environment variables.

:::important

The configuration process will require a restart of the Infrahub server and depends on your deployment method.

For detailed instructions on how to apply configuration changes to your Infrahub instance, see [How to configure Infrahub](./configuration-changes.mdx).

Essentially you will need to set the following variable to the desired value:

```shell
INFRAHUB_GIT_IMPORT_SYNC_BRANCH_NAMES=["<regex-pattern-1>","<regex-pattern-2>",...]
```

So in our case, we will set:

```shell
INFRAHUB_GIT_IMPORT_SYNC_BRANCH_NAMES=["^infra/.*$","^feature/infrahub-.*$"]
```

:::success Validation
After setting up those variables, branch synchronization should now follow the defined rules.
:::

## Step 3: Verify the configuration

To verify that the selective synchronization rules are working correctly, you'll need a Git repository connected to Infrahub. If you haven't connected a repository yet, see [How to connect external Git repositories](./repository.mdx).

Once you have a connected repository:

### Test with Git branches that should NOT be imported

1. Create a branch in your Git repository that doesn't match your rules:

```shell
git checkout -b docs/update-readme
git push origin docs/update-readme
```

2. Wait a few seconds for the synchronization cycle to complete
3. Check the Infrahub UI or API - this branch should **not** appear in Infrahub

### Test with Git branches that SHOULD be imported

1. Create a branch in your Git repository that matches your rules:

```shell
git checkout -b infra/network-update
git push origin infra/network-update
```

2. Wait a few seconds for the synchronization cycle to complete
3. Check the Infrahub UI or API - this branch **should** appear in Infrahub

### Verify using the Infrahub UI

1. Navigate to the **Branches** section in the Infrahub UI
2. Look for the branches you just created
3. Confirm that only branches matching your rules are displayed

### Verify using the API

Query the GraphQL API to list all branches:

```graphql
query {
  Branch {
    edges {
      node {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Only branches matching your configured rules should appear in the results.

## Updating synchronization rules

If you need to change your branch naming rules after the initial configuration:

### Add new patterns to expand scope

When you add new patterns to your rules, Git branches that were previously ignored will be automatically imported during the next synchronization cycle if they now match the updated rules.

**Example:**

You currently have:

```toml
sync_branch_names = ["^infra/.*$"]
```

You add a new pattern:

```toml
sync_branch_names = [
  "^infra/.*$",
  "^network/.*$"  # New pattern
]
```

Result: Existing Git branches like `network/topology` that were previously ignored will now be imported into Infrahub on the next sync.

### Remove patterns to restrict scope

When you remove patterns from your rules, existing Infrahub branches with the "sync with Git" flag enabled will continue to synchronize even if they no longer match the updated rules.

**Example:**

You currently have:

```toml
sync_branch_names = [
  "^infra/.*$",
  "^feature/.*$"
]
```

You remove a pattern:

```toml
sync_branch_names = ["^infra/.*$"]
```

Result: Existing Infrahub branches like `feature/api-update` will continue syncing because they're already established in Infrahub. The naming rules only control initial import, not ongoing synchronization.

### Clean up branches manually

If you want to stop synchronizing branches that no longer match your updated rules:

1. Identify branches in Infrahub that no longer align with your rules
2. Delete them manually through the Infrahub UI:
   - Navigate to **Branches**
   - Find the branch you want to remove
   - Click the delete option
3. Or use the API to delete branches programmatically

:::warning Permanent deletion

Manually deleting branches in Infrahub is a permanent action. The deletion will not affect the corresponding Git branches, and they will not be re-imported because they don't match your current rules.

:::

## Troubleshooting

### Branches not appearing after configuration

**Possible causes:**

- Infrahub services haven't been restarted after configuration changes
- Regular expression pattern doesn't match the branch name
- Synchronization cycle hasn't completed yet

**Solutions:**

1. Verify the configuration is correct
2. Restart Infrahub services
3. Wait 10-15 seconds for the next synchronization cycle
4. Test your regex pattern using an online regex tester

### Branches still appearing after adding rules

**Possible causes:**

- The branches were already imported before you configured the rules
- Branches have the "sync with Git" flag enabled
- Environment variable is overriding configuration file

**Solutions:**

1. Check if an environment variable is set and taking precedence
2. For existing branches, delete them manually if needed
3. The rules only control new imports, not existing branches

### All branches are being imported despite rules

**Possible causes:**

- Configuration not loaded correctly
- Services not restarted
- Syntax error in the configuration

**Solutions:**

1. Check Infrahub logs for configuration errors
2. Verify the TOML syntax is correct
3. Verify the JSON syntax is correct for environment variables
4. Restart services after any configuration change
