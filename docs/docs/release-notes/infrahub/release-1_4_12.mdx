  ([#7431](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7431))

### Fixed

- Fix bug in logic to create an object from a template that would prevent existing objects in relationships of sub-templates from being correctly linked to the created object. ([#7430](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7430))
- The artifact count has been removed from the Proposed Changes list view.
