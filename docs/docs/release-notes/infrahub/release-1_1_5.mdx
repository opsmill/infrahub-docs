# Release 1.1.5

This release is a bug-fix release to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.1.4 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Allow OIDC providers to fall back to id_token for group membership reports if they are not provided within the `userinfo` URL. This allows for group support using Azure. ([#5464](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5464))
- Add computed attributes display in schema visualizer to display the Jinja2 and Python transforms details. ([#5515](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5515))

### Fixed

- Prevent branches in a remote Git repository from being imported if they have conflicts. This can be checked in the repository task logs. ([#5085](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5085))
- Correct the form to ensure it retrieves all values from the profile accurately. ([#5276](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5276))
- Fix the multi select update mutation when removing all items. ([#5334](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5334))
- Fix parent filter rule for relationships in forms to not mark as required if the field is required. ([#5418](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5418))
- Ensure Transforms are executed with the correct timeout. ([#5456](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5456))
- Fix unexpected `Too many relationships` error while retrieving multiple nodes having the same parent. ([#5474](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5474))
- The name of generated artifacts is now using `artifact_name`, from the artifact definition, instead of the name of the definition itself. Existing artifacts will be renamed the next time they are generated. ([#5484](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5484))
- Switch Docker health check from `/api/schema/summary` to `/api/config`, to ensure that the health check works when Infrahub is configured to disallow anonymous read access. ([#5522](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5522))
- Improved format of data and schema integrity error messages on a Proposed Change to include more information.

## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.1.5"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
