# Release 1.2.12

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.2.11 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Fixed

- Remove uniqueness constraint on generic templates to support upsert mutations ([#6478](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6478))
- Add a migration to clean up duplicated data from improper merges of branches containing node schemas with an updated kind or inheritance ([#6502](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6502))
- Update the cypher query that saves a diff to use less memory. ([#6568](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6568))
- Add missing database session instantiations
- Display generic relationships with cardinality one in the object detail view.
- Fixes schema migration to add new attributes, so that it no longer adds that attribute to nodes that have been deleted. Includes a migration to clean up those illegal edges.
