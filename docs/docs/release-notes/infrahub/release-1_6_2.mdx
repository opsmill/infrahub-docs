### Fixed

<!-- vale off -->
- Fix Migration041 to determine edge uniqueness correctly and  account for incoming Relationship edges. Add new migration to un-delete improperly deleted Relationship metadata. This would only be a problem for Relationships between schemas that have both had their name, namespace, or kind updated multiple times. ([#7916](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7916))
