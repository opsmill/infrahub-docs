### Fixed

- Ensure that only users with "manage schema" permissions can add or remove dropdown and enum values ([#6410](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6410))
- Fix bug in branch delete cypher query that could leave behind orphaned branch-agnostic relationships. Includes a migration to clean up these orphaned relationships. ([#6933](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6933))
- Fix bug in display label rendering that prevented schemas from defining display labels with the same attribute names in different ways (`name` vs `name__value`, for example) ([#7022](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7022))
- Fix resource pool allocation on concurrent mutations. Assignments from the resource pools are now done within a lock to prevent invalid assignments that might occur during concurrent requests.
