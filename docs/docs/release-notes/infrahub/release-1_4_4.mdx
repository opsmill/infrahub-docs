### Fixed

- Fix HTTP 403 when trying to fetch object metadata in changelog without being allowed to manage permissions ([#ifc1760](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/ifc1760))
- Fix HTTP 403 when trying to fetch nodes though a `CoreNode` query, this could prevent users to select nodes in various places with the user interface ([#6733](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6733))
- Re-run Migration026 in case it failed during an upgrade from 1.2.4 or earlier to 1.4.x or later. Root cause of the migration failure has already been addressed. ([#7112](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7112))
- Fixed rebase bug by ensuring rebase operations with data only changes correctly set the .branched_from property of the branch within the registry. ([#7113](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7113))
- UI requests for proposed change objects are now branch-agnostic, preventing errors when a branch is deleted

### Housekeeping

- Internal UI: Decouple configuration fetching from usage
