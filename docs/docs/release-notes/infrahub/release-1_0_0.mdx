## Main changes

Infrahub 1.0 is focused on bringing Infrahub to even more organizations and equipping them with a
production-ready solution to their infrastructure automation challenges.

There are four key features and changes in Infrahub version 1.0 as outlined below:

- SSO login capabilities (OIDC/OUATH2)
- A new permission framework
- Performance enhancements to version control actions (diff/merge/rebase)
- An exciting UI and navigation redesign

In addition to these, there have been many bug-fixes and quality-of-life enhancements shown in the detailed changelog.

### Single sign-on and user permissions

Early in the development of Infrahub, we consciously decided to focus on the groundbreaking and critical features that make
Infrahub a uniquely world-class Source of Truth.
As a result, we set aside some standard enterprise features, such as Single Sign-On, until later,
knowing that they would be straightforward to implement in the system.

As we enter a new era with Infrahub 1.0, we have focused on rounding out the enterprise-grade features
that our customers require.
For example, we added Single Sign-On (SSO) integrations for OIDC/Oauth 2.0 and implemented a robust and granular permissions system.
These two features combine to give organizations a level of control that allows them to trust their mission-critical
data in Infrahub and bring even closer integration with existing enterprise systems and workflows.

#### SSO

The new OIDC/OAuth2 capabilities, tested and functioning in the field with many Identity Providers
such as Keycloak, Authentik, and Google Auth, allow organizations to manage their users and groups centrally
instead of in the Infrahub UI.
Subsequent releases of Infrahub will soon include validated support for additional Identity Providers
and other authentication methods (such as LDAP).

This functionality goes hand in hand with the feature we will discuss next: our new User Permissions structure.

##### Documentation

- [SSO Guide](../../guides/sso.mdx)

#### User permissions

As users store more data in Infrahub and more teams interact with that data, it becomes crucial to protect it
from accidental changes.
By implementing a granular role-based permission system, Infrahub allows organizations to prevent unauthorized changes
to the data behind critical infrastructure automation efforts.

In the permission structure introduced in Infrahub 1.0, Users are added to Groups, Groups are given Roles,
and Permissions are finally allocated to those Roles.
Permissions come in two fundamental varieties: Global Permissions and Object Permissions.

The below diagram lays out the relationship between each of these entities.
A User can belong to one or more Groups, a Group can have multiple Roles assigned to it, and each Role can be granted one
or more Global or Object Permissions.

!["Example relationship of User to Group to Role to Permission in Infrahub 1.0."](../../media/release_notes/infrahub_1_0/permissions_1_0.excalidraw.svg)

##### Global vs. object permissions

It is also worth mentioning the difference between Global Permissions and Object Permissions.

- Global Permissions are specific permission sets that can give users system-wide rights to perform particular actions, for example:
  - Editing the default Branch
  - Editing Permissions
  - Allowing the merging of proposed changes
  - Account management
- Object Permissions are tied to individual objects within Infrahub and control what actions users can take on those objects; examples could include:
  - Allow read-only access to all objects
  - Deny the ability to update Tags
  - Allow editing on any object type that starts with `DataCenter`

For either style, Permissions are structured to be robust and granular by allowing complete control over
the Action, Decision, and Role of a given Permission set (plus the Object Type for Object Permissions).

##### Documentation

This is a significant topic on a new feature that enables complex workflows to meet organizational needs. Because of this, we strongly recommend diving into the documentation links below.

- [Permissions Roles Topic](../../topics/permissions-roles.mdx)
- [Permissions Reference](../../reference/permissions.mdx)

### Performance improvements

Our design philosophy at OpsMill has always been driven by long experience as network practitioners or admins
in Unix-like systems: “Make it work, make it right, make it fast.”

In Infrahub 1.0, we focused on the last part, “Make it fast.”

As our early beta testers began to utilize Infrahub in increasingly large infrastructures (greater than 50,000 nodes),
we expected (and found) opportunities for performance improvements.
This was especially true when performing Version Control actions on large data sets.
As a result of the intensive testing, we made dramatic improvements to branch change management.
Infrahub 1.0 has improved how Infrahub computes a difference between two branches, re-bases a branch,
and handles the merge.
For example, in the “diff” generation for a proposed change, we have seen a 30% increase in performance over earlier versions.
As a result, the proposed change functionality can now reliably handle much larger data sets for comparison.

These performance improvements are only the beginning of our optimization efforts, but they have already improved
the experience of Infrahub users of all infrastructure sizes.

### UI redesign

While the UI in Infrahub before 1.0 served its purpose well, there was room for improvement.
A corollary fourth phrase to our design philosophy might be, “Now, make it pretty!”

We didn’t just change around some colors or styles; we worked closely with our beta testers and a dedicated
User Experience professional to ensure that using Infrahub 1.0 would be an experience that our users enjoyed.

!["Example screenshot of new UI in Infrahub 1.0."](../../media/release_notes/infrahub_1_0/1_0_ui.png)

We also provided capabilities for complete customization of the navigation menu.
We continue to emphasize that Infrahub is a powerful, fully customizable system that meets your
organization where it needs to be.

## Other

### New task-manager component

A new component called `Task Manager` has been introduced within Infrahub, and along with this change the Git-Agent has been renamed to `Task Worker`.
The task manager is based on Prefect, a popular workflow orchestration system.

The Task Manager is used internally to improve the execution and the visibility of all background tasks.
In future releases, we are planning to bring these additional information within Infrahub itself.
Stay tuned for more information and more exciting features around task management in upcoming releases.

### Removed

## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.0.0"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository [infrahub-demo-edge](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge) has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
