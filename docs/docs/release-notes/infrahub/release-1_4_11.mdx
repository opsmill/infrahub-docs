### Added

- The login form now automatically focuses on the first field.

### Fixed

- Frontend Updates
  - Consistent font size for all events in the Proposed Change timeline
  - Proposed Change action buttons now keep their size and does not stretch anymore
  - Prevent overflow on the create new relationship button within the relationship input
  - fixed typos

- SSO Fixes ([#6969](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6969))
  - Improved logging for SSO authentication to provide better debugging information
  - Enhanced error handling to properly support all error codes returned by identity providers

- Artifact Display Fixes ([#7294](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7294))
  - Correctly display XML and CSV artifacts in the UI.
  - Added a fallback to plain text for unsupported content types.

- Fix a bug that allowed duplicate attributes and/or relationships on Node or Generic schemas to be merged into the default branch,
  which would cause the application and workers to crash with an error message similar to the following:

  > ValueError: SchemaName: Names of attributes and relationships must be unique: ['field_name_1', 'field_name_2']

  Added a new CLI command `infrahub db check-duplicate-schema-fields` to resolve this duplicated schema fields issue if it appears. ([#7346](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7346))
- Fixed an issue where boolean fields in the object Details view always displayed a checkmark, even when the value was false. ([#7372](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7372))
- Fixed prefix utilization showing as greater than 100% after setting the pool attribute to false ([#7388](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7388))
- Corrected the labels on the branch list and detailed view to use the correct terminology
- Fixed issue with number pool popover stuck in the top-left corner and not expandable during the initial render in some cases.
- Improved artifacts generation and proposed change checks performance by leveraging caching and avoiding excessive GraphQL queries.
