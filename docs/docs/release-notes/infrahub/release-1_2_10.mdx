# Release 1.2.10

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.2.9 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Added the ability to use alternative value types for all attribute types with computed attributes. For attributes of type IPHost or Dropdown you can now access the `ip` or `label` fields and not only the `value` field. ([#5769](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5769))
- Computed Attribute of kind Jinja will only be recalculated during a schema update if the template itself has been updated.

### Fixed

- Fixes an issue where the signature of a webhook event was calculated wrongly. ([#6323](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6323))
- Display "dissociate" action only if possible on relationships table's row actions
- Fixed an issue where it wasn't possible to have a high number of choices in the Dropdown schema kinds. Previously the payload was limited to 4096 characters.
- Prevent creating duplicate edges on the database when adding a relationship to or deleting a relationship from a node that had its kind or inheritance updated
- Update diff and merge logic to correctly support nodes that have had their kind migrated on a branch## Upgrade guide
