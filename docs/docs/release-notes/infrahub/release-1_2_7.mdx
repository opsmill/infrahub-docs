# Release 1.2.7

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.2.6 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Security

- Update the `h11` package to 0.16.0.

### Fixed

- Mutating a backend node with extra attributes now logs an error instead of raising an error. It also fixes an issue
  preventing a corrupted node mutation. ([#6349](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6349))
- Improved the performance of computed attributes when updating a large number of objects at once. Replaced client.filter call in Jinja2 based computed attributes. ([#6351](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6351))
- Improved the IPAM allocation performance by leveraging database indexes (+10% improvement).

### Housekeeping

- Updated the Python `certifi` package to 2025.1.31.
- Updated Infrahub SDK to version 1.11.1.
