# Release 1.2.5

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.2.4 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Added support for computed attributes on generics. ([#5736](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5736))
- Added new `infrahub db selected-export` command to run an anonymized export of selected object that includes no actual data. ([#6248](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6248))
- Added a migration to correctly set children of 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0 IP prefixes if they exist.
- Updated the component relationship form to quickly create a new object and associate it to the current node.

### Changed

- Allowed using a generic in a number pool to group number allocation for all nodes inheriting from a given generic. ([#6080](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6080))
- Allowed specifying an empty string for optional text schema attributes in order to remove existing values.

### Fixed

- Refactored management of diff summary within pipelines so that they are stored in cache instead of a database. On a proposed change with large branches the size could be significant which lead to longer pipeline runs and slower lookup of tasks after they had run. ([#5866](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5866))
- Fixed the ability to override default timeout for Python transform and checks. ([#6267](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6267))
- Fixed a vertical scrolling issue in hierarchical node detailed view. ([#6269](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6269))
- Fixed a horizontal scrolling issue in tabs. ([#6272](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6272))
- Fixed the upsert operation when updating relationships with cardinality `one` or `many` having min/max count constraints.
