# Release 1.2.11

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.2.10 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Add the `CoreWeightedPoolResource` generic to better control which resource should be used when allocating from a pool. The higher the weight of the resource, the more likely it is to be selected for allocation.

### Changed

- The scrollbar in the infinite scroll tables, is now only visible when your mouse hovers the table.

### Fixed

- Fix a problem in the logic to calculate a diff that could cause it to quit too early under certain unlikely circumstances
- Fixes an issue where the next page of data was loaded even when the infinite scroll table wasn't scrolled.

## Upgrade guide

Please refer to the Upgrade Guide in the documentation for more information on how to upgrade your Infrahub instance.

[Upgrade Guide](../../guides/upgrade.mdx)

**After the upgrade, it is strongly recommended to rebase any open branches in Infrahub once the system is online again.**
