## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.0.7"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository [infrahub-demo-edge](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge) has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
