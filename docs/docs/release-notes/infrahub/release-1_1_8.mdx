# Release 1.1.8

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.1.7 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Changed

- Improved the performance of the cypher query that saves a diff in the database.
- Updated the DiffUpdate mutation to return the ID of the task when `wait_until_completion` is False. Also, the argument `wait_for_completion` under the data section is deprecated and it has been replaced with `wait_until_completion` at the root of the mutation instead to align with the format of the other mutations.

### Fixed

- Fixed an error in the query to count the number of peers for a given cardinality-many relationship. Existing logic could have resulted in the count being multiplied by a power of 2 if changes were made to the relationship during a merge.
- Fixed the HFID format in the mutations `IPAddressPoolGetResource` and `IPPrefixPoolGetResource`.
- Reduced the number of database queries we run when checking a uniqueness constraint during a node update or create mutation. Specifically in the instance that node uses a schema which inherits from a generic schema and the node schema's uniqueness constraints are contained within the generic schema's uniqueness constraints.
- Removed duplicated edges that could have been added to the database during concurrent updates.

## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.1.8"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
