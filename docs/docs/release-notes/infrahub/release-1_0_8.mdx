# Release 1.0.8

This release is a bug-fix release to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.0.7 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Add `sso_user_default_group` security setting to provide the name of a group to which SSO users will be assigned if the identity provider does not gives a list of groups to use ([#4924](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4924))
- Added a 'append_git_suffix' configuration setting for Git repositories that allows you to define domains for auto appending '.git' to repositories defined with an HTTP URL ([#5077](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5077))

### Fixed

- Loosened up logic to determine when an artifact needs to be regenerated during a proposed change. This is to ensure that we always generate a new artifact if required. Until some other parts are refactored this will also need that we will generate artifacts in a few situations where it's not strictly required. This last part is a temporary solution. ([#4198](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4198))
- Migrates from headless UI combobox to `cmdk` to resolve focus behavior issues when there is no result in the search anywhere ([#4715](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4715))
- Fix GraphQL mutations to make user permissions updates work correctly
  - Update the alert message to better reflect the changes (between creation and update)
  - Fix the objects delete modal on the global permission view
  - Fix the global permission update mutation

  ([#4881](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4881), [#4952](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4952))
- Validate that a deleted schema node is not used in any relationship when loading a new schema ([#4912](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4912))
- Set content type of artifact when rendered to fix artifact content type if artifact definition has changed ([#4969](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4969))
- Raise error if pool allocation misses data to create node ([#5006](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5006))
- Process new schema before replacing branch in registry to avoid causing the GraphQL schema to be generated while the new schema is still loading ([#5008](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5008))
- Added a check on repository import and sync to wait until the schema has converged before importing additional objects when the repository contains an updated schema ([#5051](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5051))
- Fix artifact definition targets when changed in repository so that it's reflected in the database ([#5060](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5060))
- GraphQL query with filters on attribute of type List return the expected result ([#5091](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5091))
- Prevent adding a new mandatory attribute or relationship to the schema if some nodes are already present in the database ([#5106](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5106))
- Ensure that permission queries are run in non isolated mode so that updates from the default branch are automatically reflected in other branches ([#5110](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5110))
- Add retry for transient database errors during IP reconciliation tasks
- Corrected configuration for prefect worker to never prompt for Git credentials on the console
- Fix artifact object relationship by enforcing it to be an artifact target
- Fix bug in IP reconciliation query around deleted nodes and relationships
- Fix issue that could cause diff generation to crash if a schema was renamed
- Fixes a bug that prevented running a generator from a read-only repository
- Generator groups are correctly created after merging a proposed change

## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.0.8"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
