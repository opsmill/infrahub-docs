### Added

- Added optional configuration to fetch and map groups when using Google as an identity provider for OAuth/OIDC.
- Added the name of the artifact definition to the payload of artifact webhook events.

### Fixed

- Allow RequestGraphQLQueryGroupUpdate parameters to accept any type of value, not just strings. ([#7208](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7208))
- The available IPs filter in IPAM list views now stays applied when switching kind.
