### Fixed

- Improve performance of uniqueness constraint checks during create/update/upsert mutations by allowing ordering elements from more specific to less specific within a constraint group ([#6377](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6377))
- Fixed: min/max constraints no longer trigger on empty values when the field is optional. ([#6671](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6671))
- Object template ([#6724](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6724))
  - Fixed "Kind" filter in object template list view.
  - Fixed search in object template selector during creation form
- Improve performance when calculating a large diff with many added and/or deleted node (>2,000) ([#6751](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6751))
