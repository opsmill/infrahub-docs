### Fixed

<!-- vale off -->
- Fix migration that backfills display labels and human-friendly IDs to account for schema that only exist on the branch being migrated.
  Add new migration to add display labels and human-friendly IDs to existing instances of templates and profiles. ([#7655](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7655))
- Prevent attempting diff update on a deleted branch. Log a warning instead. ([#7666](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7666))
