### Fixed

- Fix issue with template that would set the value/source of all attributes even for the attribute that are not defined in the template. ([#7259](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7259))
- Fix bug in artifact diff cypher query that could improperly exclude artifacts on the default branch ([#7301](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7301))

### Housekeeping

- Update docs to download compose file first and then run compose up/down. This change was made due to community members using the one liner for long standing installations without the docker-compose.yml file locally. The new approach is more explicit and easier for the community to maintain their Infrahub instances in the future. ([#compose](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/compose))
