### Added

- Add a new check for orphaned Relationship vertices to `infrahub db check`

### Fixed

- Fix repository objects view when there is no group tied to the repository [repository-objects](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/repo-objects)
- Prevent Python keywords from being used as attribute/relationship names in schemas. Schema validation now rejects Python keywords (like `from`, `class`, `import`) as attribute or relationship names, preventing 500 errors during GraphQL schema generation. ([#6730](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6730))
- Fix bug in diff calculation logic that could prevent the diff from generating if the peer of a deleted node had its kind or inheritance changed on multiple branches ([#6928](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6928))
- Fix an issue in a cypher query to get the peers of a node that has been migrated for a kind or inheritance update.
- Fix an issue in the diff calculation that could double count properties of a node that has been migrated for a kind or inheritance update.
