### Added

- Added "parallel mode" plugin to the GraphQL web sandbox.
- GraphQL query parsing and validation is now leveraging a cache to improve performance and CPU consumption.

### Changed

- Infinite scrolling now fetches more entries per page when having a lot of objects. ([#8057](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8057))

### Fixed

- Fixed issue around the use of the `validate_certificates` attribute on webhooks. This change also modifies this attribute so that it no longer has a default value, instead the Infrahub default configuration for HTTP is used and the attribute is only to override the default. ([#6308](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6308))
- Fixed a bug that caused branch-agnostic attributes on branch-aware objects to be deleted globally when the object was deleted. Now branch-agnostic attributes on branch-aware objects are only deleted on the branch where the object was deleted. ([#7513](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7513))
- Figure number and IPAM resources to allocate from a pool by using Cypher queries instead of iterating logic, this should fix timeout observed when allocating resources within large pools ([#7897](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7897))
- Fixed an issue where parallel create or update operations would attach multiple peers to a cardinality one relationship. ([#7972](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/7972))
- Search anywhere bar now scale with the number of objects within Infrahub.
  Cardinality many relationships are now ignored and not shown in search results. ([#8059](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8059))
- Prevent opening a proposed change if there is already an open proposed change for the branch. ([#8123](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8123))
- Fix bug in node create logic that could cause edges to be added to the database with the wrong hierarchy level on the global branch. Includes a migration to fix existing problem edges. ([#8158](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8158))
- Fix bug in node create logic that could cause branch-local edges to be added to the database with the wrong hierarchy level. Includes a migration to fix existing problem edges. ([#8159](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8159))
- Fix diff update logic to prevent crash when copying a diff with recursive relationships ([#8165](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8165))
- Update branch delete logic to correctly delete branch-agnostic attributes from objects being deleted with the branch. Includes a migration to clean up any orphaned objects with branch-agnostic attributes left in the database. ([#8211](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8211))
- Prevent creating duplicate schemas on branches and merging them into the default branch ([#8221](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8221))
- Fixed an issue where unexpected restarts of tasks workers would result in tasks being in "Running" state forever.
  As a side effect, this would block Git repositories sync tasks to be launched. ([#8227](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8227))
- Fixed an issue causing over fetching in IPAM tree
- When using local docs, icons and images are correctly loaded.
