# Release 1.2.4

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.2.3 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Fixed

- Fixed the migration to remove an attribute from a schema to correctly ignore overridden attributes from a generic schema. ([#6073](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/6073))
- Fixed an issue where HFID and uniqueness constraints for component templates would end up having duplicate elements after loading several schemas.
- Fixed an issue where optional unique attributes having a NULL value could be duplicated.
  Upgrading Infrahub to a version containing this fix will perform a check identifying such duplicates.
  If some duplicates are found, data or schema should be fixed in order to complete the upgrade:
  - Either the uniqueness constraint on corresponding attributes should be removed within schema.
  - Or duplicated unique attributes values should be modified.
- Properly clear references to old branches and schema objects from the registry when deleting branches.
- Restricted event.related payload for CoreGraphQLQueryGroup events.
