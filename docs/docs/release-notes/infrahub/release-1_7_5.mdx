### Removed

- Removed unused `enable` configuration toggle from broker, cache, and workflow settings

### Fixed

- Add migration to handle setting duplicated schemas on the default branch to be deleted, keeping the one with the latest update ([#8221](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8221))
- Handle deleted parent relationship schemas when combining diffs without crashing ([#8388](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8388))
- Prevent saving generated "profiles" and "object_template" schema relationships to the database. Includes a migration to clean up any already on the database. ([#8426](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8426))
- Fixed regression (introduced in Infrahub 1.5) regarding merge performance. ([#8438](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8438))
- Add full support for updating existing Template instances via schema migrations when the associated node or generic schema is updated in a manner that would add or remove attributes to or from the Template's schema.
- Adds automatic retries to database queries during a branch merge to handle transient errors
- Allow generating Template schemas for both a generic schema and a node inheriting from that generic. Previously, schema validation would raise a validation error and prevent this.
- Fixed an issue where Infrahub was calculating the wrong authentication signature caused by HTTPX v0.28.0 switching to compact JSON payload encoding.
- Fixed issue where system user showed as the last user changing a proposed change after merge
