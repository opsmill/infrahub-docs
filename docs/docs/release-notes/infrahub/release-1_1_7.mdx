# Release 1.1.7

This release brings some changes and bug-fixes to resolve issues found in Infrahub v1.1.6 and prior.

## Main changes

The complete list of changes can always be found in the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the Infrahub Git repository.

### Added

- Data diffs are loaded in sequential batches for faster performance with large changes.
- The diff tree and diff list can now be scrolled independently.

### Changed

- Modified node mutation events to not send metadata properties as part of the mutation payload. The reason is that the property lookup was time consuming. This information will return again in Infrahub 1.2 with a completely updated format. ([#5664](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5664))

### Fixed

- Fix nodes remaining in the database after a create mutation fails when using pools. ([#4303](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/4303))
- Modify the query for the current tasks, ensuring the correct determination of the merge button state. ([#5565](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5565))
- Fix Docker `task-manager-db` PostgreSQL health check test by adding database and user parameters. ([#5739](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/5739))
- Fixed issue causing a gap in menu sidebar when text is too long.
- Prevent avatar from being cut off in menu sidebar.
- Enforce permission checks when using relationship add or delete mutation.
- Enhance the data integrity checks UI to enable navigation from the check to the diff view.
- Improved performance when updating an existing diff.

## Migration guide

The process to migrate your instance of Infrahub to the latest version may vary depending on your deployment of Infrahub.
However, at a high-level, it will involve getting the latest version of the Infrahub code, and then performing any needed Database Migrations and Schema updates.

Please ensure you have a **backup of your Infrahub environment** prior to attempting any migration or upgrade activities.

### Migration of an Infrahub instance

**First**, update the Infrahub version running in your environment.

Below are some example ways to get the latest version of Infrahub in your environment.

- For deployments via Docker Compose, update your container version by updating the `VERSION` environment variable and relaunch:
  - `export VERSION="1.1.7"; docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- For deployments via Kubernetes, utilize the latest version of the Helm chart supplied with this release

**Second**, once you have gotten the desired version of Infrahub in your environment, please run the following commands.

> Note: If you are running Infrahub in Docker/K8s, these commands need to run from a container where Infrahub is installed.

```shell
infrahub db migrate
infrahub db update-core-schema
```

**Finally**, restart all instances of Infrahub.

### Migration of a dev or demo instance

If you are using the `dev` or `demo` environments, we have provided `invoke` commands to aid in the migration to the latest version.
The below examples provide the `demo` version of the commands, however similar commands can be used for `dev` as well.

```shell
invoke demo.stop
invoke demo.build
invoke demo.migrate
invoke demo.start
```

If you don't want to keep your data, you can start a clean instance with the following command.

> **Warning: All data will be lost, please make sure to backup everything you need before running this command.**

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.build demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

The repository [infrahub-demo-edge](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge) has also been updated, it's recommended to pull the latest changes into your fork.
