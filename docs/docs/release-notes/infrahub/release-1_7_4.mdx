### Removed

- Removed references to the deprecated `is_visible` metadata property from documentation.

### Fixed

- Fix bug in computed attribute calculation that prevented having a computed attribute on a branch if there were no computed attributes on the default branch ([#8270](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8270))
- Add migration to allow rebasing branches created before ([#8221](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/issues/8221)) was fixed so that the uniqueness constraint on SchemaNode.name and SchemaGeneric.name is removed
- Fixed branch merge failing to include relationships to AGNOSTIC nodes (e.g., CoreIPAddressPool) by including the global branch in the peer node lookup query.
- Fixed confusing issue when "off" was converted to boolean 'false' due to issues with Yaml. The bug was that if "off" or something that Yaml parses as a boolean was used as the name of a Dropdown the incorrect attribute was highlighted in the schema error. When this happened troubleshooting was harder due to misleading errors pointing to another attribute.
