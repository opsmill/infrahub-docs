# Documentation guide

Welcome to the Infrahub documentation guide. This document aims to answer any questions that may come up when creating or updating documentation.

## Base prerequisites

## Working with the docs site locally

The recommended way to run and build the docs locally is with Infrahub's suite of `invoke`-driven tasks.

Use the Invoke tasks to build the documentation and generate source code derived documentation.

```shell
invoke docs.build docs.generate
```

Once the documentation has been built, make sure to validate the documentation.

```shell
invoke docs.validate
```

After the documentation has been validated, it can be served locally on port **3000**.

```shell
invoke docs.serve
```

<ReferenceLink title="Explore the local documentation" url="http://localhost:3000/" openInNewTab />

To see more documentation Invoke tasks use the help functionality.

```shell
invoke -l docs
```

```shell
Available 'docs' tasks:

  .build                   Build documentation website.
  .format                  This will run all formatter.
  .format-markdownlint     Run markdownlint-cli2 to format all .md/mdx files.

  .generate-repository     Generate documentation for the repository configuration file.
  .generate-schema         Generate documentation for the schema.
  .install                 Install documentation dependencies.
  .lint                    This will run all linter.
  .markdownlint
  .serve                   Run documentation server in development mode.
  .vale                    Run vale to validate the documentation.
  .validate                Validate that the generated documentation is committed to Git.
```

## Linting and automation

Infrahub uses [Vale](https://vale.sh) to check grammar, style, and word usage. You can find Vale's configuration in `.vale.ini`, and the Infrahub styles located in `.vale/styles/Infrahub`.

[Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) is used to encourage consistent markdown files, and Infrahub's configuration is located at `.markdownlint.yaml`.

Most Vale warnings match up with the [style guide](#style-guide) explanations below. Other warnings often fall into the `Infrahub.spelling` rule. These are caused by misspellings, product names, names of people, or otherwise unknown technical terms. See the [procedures for updating rules](#spelling-errors) below for details on adding terms to the approved list.

### Install vscode linting extensions

It is preferred to install extensions into VSCode so that you can see the visual errors and fix them as you write documentation.

- [Vale](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrischinchilla.vale-vscode)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)

### Disabling Vale and markdownlint

You can disable Vale and markdownlint in-line with the following markdown comments:

```markdown
<!-- vale off -->
Ignored Specialized Phrase ignored by vale
<!-- vale on -->

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
## Ignored markdown line
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->
```

This is useful in situations where specific style choices or markdown quirks force the use of an otherwise conflicting rule. In general, it is better to update existing configurations or create new rules rather than disable scanning of individual files.

### Creating new Vale rules

For questions regarding how to add to or update an existing rule, see the [Vale styles documentation](https://vale.sh/docs/topics/styles/). A wealth of examples are also available in [GitLab's vale configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/doc/.vale/gitlab).

#### Spelling errors

If Vale warns of a spelling mistake and the word is valid, you can fix it by updating the `spelling-exceptions.txt` file in the `.vale/styles/` directory. When adding a new term, update and alphabetize the list to make future scanning easier.

#### Common replacement words

Add common shorthand words and phrases that have better alternatives to the `swap.yml` rule. For example, `repo` becomes `repository`.

Add special case capitalization words to the `branded-terms-case-swap.yml` rule. For example, `Github` becomes `GitHub`.

## Writing markdown

Pages are written in MDX, which is a enhanced version of markdown or generated by the app source.

In addition, Docusaurus has its own [markdown-inspired components](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features). You'll often find reference links, panels, and snippets used throughout the Infrahub docs.

### Markdown tips

#### Ensure proper newlines

Use two full returns between paragraphs (one empty line). This ensures a new paragraph is created.

#### Notification blocks

When writing documentation, it's essential to guide the reader's attention to specific types of information. Notification blocks are a powerful tool to achieve this, allowing you to highlight information based on its nature and importance. Here are the types of notification blocks and how to use them:

- **Info:** Use info blocks for additional, helpful information that isn't required to complete the task but offers more context or useful tips.

  ```markdown
  :::info
  ```

  **Example**
  :::info This feature is available in version 2.1 and later.
  :::

- **Success:** Use success blocks to highlight expected outcomes and "status checks" to ensure the reader is on track with the guide. These blocks can reinforce the reader's progress and provide positive feedback.

  ```markdown
  :::success
  ```

  **Example**
  :::success If you've followed the steps correctly, your installation should now be complete.
  :::

- **Warning:** Warning blocks should be used to highlight common errors or mistakes that may occur during the process. They serve as preventive measures to help the reader avoid potential pitfalls.

  ```markdown
  :::warning
  ```

  **Example**
  :::warning Ensure you've backed up your files before proceeding with this step to prevent data loss.
  :::

- **Danger:** Use danger blocks to highlight irreversible or breaking actions. These notifications are critical for steps that could significantly affect the system or data if mishandled.

  ```markdown
  :::danger
  ```

  **Example**
  :::danger This action will permanently delete your data and cannot be undone.
  :::

Incorporating these blocks into your documentation makes it more interactive and user-friendly, guiding the reader through different stages of their learning or implementation process with visual cues that emphasize the significance of each piece of information.

## Organizing new pages

We organize all documentation into **four** categories: tutorials, guides, topics, and reference. This is heavily influenced by the [Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/). The goal is to maintain a more organized, understandable set of docs.

Here are questions to ask when deciding where to place a new document:

- Are you walking the user through a scenario? Select **Tutorials**.
- Are you providing steps to complete a specific task? Select **Guides**.
- Are you providing background information, explanation, or abstract concepts? Select **Topics**.
- Are you providing APIs, command references, or concise reference information? Select **Reference**.

If you're unsure where something goes, diátaxis offers a [map](https://diataxis.fr/needs/) and [compass](https://diataxis.fr/compass/) to help.

When creating a new page in the documentation, in addition to creating the `.mdx` file containing the documentation itself, you must also add the page to the relevant section of the `sidebars.ts` file.

### Tutorials

Tutorials are an opportunity to guide users through a repeatable process. The purpose is to **provide basic competence** in Infrahub or a feature-set.

They should:

- Introduce the user to the end goal.
- Be repeatable by any user.
- Describe practical steps, rather than abstract concepts.
- Provide immediate results.

The "Getting started" tutorial is a good example, as it walks the user through a scripted scenario in a demo environment.

For a deeper dive into tutorials, refer to the [diátaxis tutorials page](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/).

>Tutorials are complex learning endeavors. Before deciding if a tutorial is necessary, consider how you might update an existing tutorial or if a guide would be a better option.

### Guides

Guides may seem like tutorials, but they are a shorter set of universal instructions that can apply to any user's task. The purpose is to **teach how to perform a specific task**.

**Naming guideline:** Describe the task that the guide describes, preferably in 2-5 words.

For example:

- Installing Infrahub
- Creating new devices
- How to invite collaborators

For a deeper dive into guides, refer to the [diátaxis guides page](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/).

### Topics

Sometimes called *explanations*, topics offer additional context and rationale into the workings of Infrahub. They should answer the question: "how does X work?"

**Naming guideline:** Write the topic name, but not a sentence.

For example:

- Artifact
- User management and authentication

Begin by giving a one to two sentence description of the topic, then dive in deeper as needed.

For a deeper dive into topics, refer to the [diátaxis explanations page](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/).

### Reference

Reference docs serve a single purpose. To provide quick, clear information when a user needs it. The intention is not that users *read* the reference, but instead they *consult* it as needed when working with Infrahub.

**Naming guidelines:** Mirror the code-level naming guidelines where possible. This makes it easier to connect docs to code quickly.

For a deeper dive into reference docs, refer to the [diátaxis reference page](https://diataxis.fr/reference/).

## Application screenshots

To ensure that Infrahub's screenshots remain up to date and to check that our guides work properly, we use [end-to-end (e2e) tests](../development/frontend/testing-guidelines#e2e-tests). You'll find the e2e tests specifically designed for tutorials located in `frontend/app/tests/e2e/tutorial`.

### Updating all screenshots manually

#### 1. Start with a fresh data environment

Start with fresh demo data each time you want to take new screenshots, as the tests are not idempotent. This ensures consistency across screenshots.

```shell
invoke dev.destroy dev.start dev.load-infra-schema dev.load-infra-data dev.infra-git-import dev.infra-git-create
```

#### 2. run the e2e tests

E2E test commands are accessible through inside the `frontend/app` directory. To run the tests with screenshots, execute:

```shell
cd frontend/app
npm run test:e2e:screenshots
```

:::info
By default, tests are run in headless mode. To run them in a visible browser, use `npm run test:e2e:screenshots:headed` instead.
:::

#### 3. Check the results

The screenshots will be saved in `docs/docs/media`. You can then use them in our documentation:

```markdown
![optional caption](../../media/my-screenshot-name.png)
```

### Add a screenshot

#### 1. Locate on which test the screenshot should be added

If the test does not exist yet, create must create it first. Refer to the [write e2e tests](../development/frontend/testing-guidelines#writing-e2e-tests) for more information.

#### 2. Add the screenshot

To add a new screenshot in the documentation, use this command within the tutorial e2e test:

```ts
await saveScreenshotForDocs(page, "my-screenshot-name");
```

You can also organize your screenshots using folders, by specifying the folder name like this:

```ts
await saveScreenshotForDocs(page, "my-folder/my-screenshot-name" );
```

## Style guide

As a general rule, prefer consistency and simplicity when possible. This guide should help in making choices, but it is a living document and should evolve as the needs of the project evolve. For anything not answered below, reference the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

General tips:
<!-- vale off -->
- Avoid words like *easy*, *just*, or *simple* to describe how to do something or how "easy" a task is.
<!-- vale on -->
- If a sentence looks too long, it probably is. Try and simplify it or break it into multiple sentences.
- Avoid jargon unless you are sure the reader knows the term.
- Don't hesitate to link between pages and concepts.
- Avoid repeating information when possible, and instead link out to topic or reference pages.

### Language

We use American English for most standard text. Unique technical terms are [included below](#common-external-words), or in the [Microsoft A-Z word list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

### Trailing commas

Use a trailing comma when listing multiple items. This is commonly known as the Oxford comma or serial comma.

**:x: Don't do this:** There are devices, organizations and users.

**:white_check_mark: Do this:** There are devices, organizations, and users.

### Headings and titles

Headings and titles should capitalize the first word only and end with no punctuation. The exception being any proper noun.

**:x: Don't do this**: Getting Started!

**:white_check_mark: Do this**: Getting started

Every page should have a top-level heading. Additional heading tiers can only exist if a higher tier has been used.

**:x: Don't do this**:

```markdown
<!-- This is missing an h2 -->
# Page title

### Smaller heading
```

### Avoid over-capitalization

It is tempting to want to capitalize all feature names. Unless the term is a named marketing feature, avoid capitalization.

**:x: Don't do this**: Git Repository, API Server, User Management

**:white_check_mark: Do this**: Git repository, API server, user management

### Lists

Capitalize the first letter of each list item. If an item is a complete sentence, give it a period at the end. If it's not, it is okay to omit punctuation. The [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists) has a good explanation of how to handle list punctuation.

When listing items and descriptions, prefer the use of a colon (:) instead of a dash (-).

```markdown
<!-- Don't do this -->
- Not - this
- Or - this

<!-- Do this -->
- Do: this
- And: this
```

### Colons

Avoid extra spaces before a colon.

```markdown
<!-- Don't do this -->
Feature : Explanation of feature

<!-- Do this -->

Feature: Explanation of feature
```

### Code blocks

When creating a code block or snippet with three backticks, make sure to include a language designation.
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
~~~md
```shell
this is a shell script
```
~~~
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

### Marking code items

Sometimes you need to mention a `function` or `ModelName`. To do so, use the inline code backticks in markdown.

### Use i.e. for examples

Prefer `i.e.` over `e.g.` or `ex.`. In a sentence, `i.e.` is surrounded by commas.

For example: *Select the current branch, i.e., 'main'.*

It's also acceptable and clearer to use "for example" or "such as".

### Common external words

Refer to external brand guidelines for capitalization rules. Here are some common spellings and uses for brands found in the Infrahub docs. Additional terms can be found in `.vale/styles/Infrahub/branded-terms-case-swap.yml`.

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Git
- RabbitMQ
- GraphQL
- MacOS
- Linux
