# Getting set up with frontend

:::warning Before we start

Make sure [Infrahub Backend](../backend.mdx) is up and running. If not, in your terminal execute:

```shell
invoke demo.destroy demo.start demo.load-infra-schema demo.load-infra-data
```

:::

Infrahub is built with React. Make sure you're running Node.js 22+ and npm 10+, to verify, run:

```shell
node --version
npm --version
```

## 1. Install dependencies

```shell
cd frontend/app
npm install
```

## 2. Start a local server

```shell
npm start
```

You can access your local server at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). If you are not familiar with Infrahub, follow our [Getting Started Guide](../../getting-started/overview.mdx).

## 3. Run all tests

### Unit & integration tests

```shell
npm run test

# same with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### E2E tests

npm run test:e2e
```

All tests should succeed. For more information on testing, read [Running & Writing Tests](testing-guidelines.mdx).
