# Documentation style guide

This guide defines writing style, capitalization, and grammar rules for Infrahub documentation. As a general rule, prefer consistency and simplicity when possible. For anything not answered below, reference the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

General tips:
<!-- vale off -->
- Avoid words like *easy*, *just*, or *simple* to describe how to do something or how "easy" a task is.
<!-- vale on -->
- If a sentence looks too long, it probably is. Try and simplify it or break it into multiple sentences.
- Avoid jargon unless you are sure the reader knows the term.
- Don't hesitate to link between pages and concepts.
- Avoid repeating information when possible, and instead link out to topic or reference pages.

## Infrahub terminology

> **Capitalize nouns that represent first-class, named Infrahub capabilities with defined behavior and APIs.**
> **Do not capitalize generic industry concepts, even when Infrahub produces or uses them.**

### Generators

**Always capitalize** when referring to the Infrahub feature.

Generator is not a widely established industry term. In Infrahub, a Generator is a named system concept with specific semantics (idempotent, service-model-driven, graph-aware).

| Usage | Correct | Incorrect |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Feature reference | "Infrahub **Generators** convert service models into objects." | "Infrahub generators convert..." |
| Plural | "Configure your **Generators** in the repository." | "Configure your generators..." |

### Transformations

**Always capitalize** when referring to the Infrahub feature. Use "transform" only as a verb, never as a noun.

While "transformation" is a common word, Infrahub Transformations have a specific execution model, defined inputs (GraphQL queries), and defined outputs (artifacts).

| Usage | Correct | Incorrect |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Feature reference | "**Transformations** convert graph data into artifacts." | "transformations convert..." |
| As a verb | "Use this to **transform** data into vendor formats." | "Use this Transform to..." |
| Noun form | "Create a **Transformation** for configuration generation." | "Create a transform for..." |

**Never use "transform" or "transforms" as a noun.** Always use "Transformation" or "Transformations".

### Artifacts

**Do NOT capitalize** unless it starts a sentence or is at the beginning of a bullet point where other items are also capitalized.

Artifact is a broadly accepted industry term. Infrahub artifacts are not conceptually novel in the same way Generators or Transformations are.

| Usage | Correct | Incorrect |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Mid-sentence | "The **artifact** is stored in object storage." | "The Artifact is stored..." |
| Start of sentence | "**Artifacts** are generated automatically." | "artifacts are generated..." |
| In a capitalized list | "- **Artifacts**: Generated outputs..." | "- **artifacts**: Generated outputs..." (if other items start capitalized) |

### Profiles

**Always capitalize** when referring to the Infrahub feature.

| Usage | Correct | Incorrect |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Feature reference | "Infrahub **Profiles** allow you to..." | "Infrahub profiles allow..." |
| Plural | "Create **Profiles** for your devices." | "Create profiles for..." |

### Resource Manager

**Always capitalize** and **always use singular form**.

| Usage | Correct | Incorrect |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Feature reference | "Use **Resource Manager** to allocate IPs." | "Use Resource Managers..." |
| Plural context | "Configure **Resource Manager** instances." | "Configure Resource Managers." |

### Quick reference table

| Term | Capitalize? | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Generator(s) | Yes | Infrahub-specific primitive |
| Transformation(s) | Yes | First-class capability (noun form) |
| transform | No | Verb only |
| artifact(s) | No | Generic industry term (capitalize at sentence/list start) |
| Profile(s) | Yes | Infrahub-specific feature |
| Resource Manager | Yes | Always singular, system-level capability |

## Language

We use American English for most standard text. Unique technical terms are [included below](#product-and-technology-names), or in the [Microsoft A-Z word list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

## Trailing commas

Use a trailing comma when listing multiple items. This is commonly known as the Oxford comma or serial comma.

**:x: Don't do this:** There are devices, organizations, and users.

**:white_check_mark: Do this:** There are devices, organizations, and users.

## Headings and titles

Headings and titles should capitalize the first word only and end with no punctuation. The exception being any proper noun.

**:x: Don't do this**: Getting Started!

**:white_check_mark: Do this**: Getting started

Every page should have a top-level heading. Additional heading tiers can only exist if a higher tier has been used.

**:x: Don't do this**:

```markdown
<!-- This is missing an h2 -->
# Page title

### Smaller heading
```

## Avoid over-capitalization

It is tempting to want to capitalize all feature names. Unless the term is a named marketing feature, avoid capitalization.

**:x: Don't do this**: Git Repository, API Server, User Management

**:white_check_mark: Do this**: Git repository, API server, user management

## Lists

Capitalize the first letter of each list item. If an item is a complete sentence, give it a period at the end. If it's not, it is okay to omit punctuation. The [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/scannable-content/lists) has a good explanation of how to handle list punctuation.

When listing items and descriptions, prefer the use of a colon (:) instead of a dash (-).

```markdown
<!-- Don't do this -->
- Not - this
- Or - this

<!-- Do this -->
- Do: this
- And: this
```

### Bullet point lists

When a word appears at the start of a bullet point in a list where other items begin with capitalized words, capitalize it for consistency.

**Correct:**
```markdown
- **Caching**: Generated artifacts are stored...
- **Traceability**: Past values remain available...
- **Peer Review**: Artifacts are automatically part of...
- **Database**: Artifact nodes are stored...
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
- **Caching**: Generated artifacts are stored...
- **Traceability**: Past values remain available...
- **Peer Review**: artifacts are automatically part of...  <!-- Should be capitalized -->
- **Database**: artifact nodes are stored...               <!-- Should be capitalized -->
```

### Link text in lists

When a word appears as link text at the start of a bullet point in a list where other items begin with capitalized words, capitalize it.

**Correct:**
```markdown
- [Version control](version-control): Understand how branches work...
- [Schema](schema): Learn about data models...
- [Artifacts](artifact): Explore generated outputs...
- [Generators](generator): Learn about code generation...
```

**Incorrect:**
```markdown
- [Version control](version-control): Understand how branches work...
- [Schema](schema): Learn about data models...
- [artifacts](artifact): Explore generated outputs...  <!-- Should be capitalized -->
- [generators](generator): Learn about code generation...  <!-- Should be capitalized -->
```

## Colons

Avoid extra spaces before a colon.

```markdown
<!-- Don't do this -->
Feature : Explanation of feature

<!-- Do this -->

Feature: Explanation of feature
```

## Code blocks

When creating a code block or snippet with three backticks, make sure to include a language designation.
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
~~~md
```shell
this is a shell script
```
~~~
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

## Marking code items

Sometimes you need to mention a `function` or `ModelName`. To do so, use the inline code backticks in markdown.

## Excalidraw diagrams

You can attach `.excalidraw` diagrams to visually explain concepts, workflows, or processes within the documentation.

:::warning
Always save Excalidraw files with the "Embed Scene" option checked to maintain the ability to edit in VS Code.
:::

## Use i.e. for examples

Prefer `i.e.` over `e.g.` or `ex.`. In a sentence, `i.e.` is surrounded by commas.

For example: *Select the current branch, i.e., 'main'.*

It's also acceptable and clearer to use "for example" or "such as".

## Product and technology names

Always use correct capitalization for these terms:

- Ansible
- Docker, DockerHub
- Git
- GitHub, GitLab, GitPod
- Grafana
- GraphQL
- InfluxDB
- Infrahub
- Jinja2
- K3s, K8s, Kubernetes
- Linux
- MacOS
- MySQL
- Neo4j
- NGINX
- Node.js
- OpenAPI, OpenConfig
- OpsMill
- PostgreSQL
- Prometheus
- Python
- RabbitMQ
- Terraform
- Ubuntu
- VS Code
