This tutorial shows an example of cloud resource management schema, which provides a vendor-agnostic way to model cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure. You'll load sample cloud data and explore how Infrahub can serve as a unified inventory for multi-cloud environments.

## Overview

The cloud schema enables you to track:

- **Cloud providers** - AWS, GCP, Azure, or other cloud platforms
- **Cloud accounts** - AWS accounts, GCP projects, Azure subscriptions
- **Regions and availability zones** - Geographic locations and fault domains
- **Virtual networks** - VPCs (AWS), VPC networks (GCP), VNets (Azure)
- **Subnets** - Network segments within virtual networks
- **Security groups** - Network access control rules (Security Groups, Firewall Rules, NSGs)
- **Compute instances** - Virtual machines across all providers
- **Network infrastructure** - Internet gateways, NAT gateways, route tables, elastic IPs
- **Network interfaces** - ENIs, NICs attached to instances

This vendor-agnostic model allows you to manage multi-cloud infrastructure from a single source of truth, with consistent naming and relationships regardless of the underlying cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed the [installation guide](./install.mdx) and have Infrahub running
- Loaded the bootstrap data and schemas
- Access to the Infrahub web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

## Loading cloud demo data

The demo includes sample data for all three major cloud providers with realistic infrastructure examples.

The easiest way to load the cloud demo is using the provided invoke task:

```bash
uv run invoke demo-cloud
```

This command:

1. Creates a new branch named `demo-cloud`
2. Loads all schemas (including the cloud schema)
3. Loads cloud object files with sample data for AWS, GCP, and Azure
4. Displays a URL to view the cloud resources

## Exploring cloud resources

After loading the demo data, navigate to the cloud resources in the Infrahub web interface.

### Viewing all cloud resources

1. Ensure you're on the correct branch (for example, `demo-cloud`)
2. Navigate to **Cloud Resource** in the left sidebar menu
3. You'll see a list of all cloud resource types

Or access the cloud resources directly:

```text
http://localhost:8000/objects/CloudResource?branch=demo-cloud
```

### Sample data structure

The demo includes a comprehensive multi-cloud environment:

#### Cloud providers (3)

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

#### Cloud accounts (12)

Each provider has production, staging, and development accounts:

- `opsmill-aws-production`, `opsmill-aws-staging`, `opsmill-aws-dev`
- `opsmill-gcp-production`, `opsmill-gcp-staging`, `opsmill-gcp-dev`
- `opsmill-azure-production`, `opsmill-azure-staging`, `opsmill-azure-dev`

#### Regions and availability zones

- **AWS**: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), EU West (Ireland)
- **GCP**: US Central (Iowa), US East (South Carolina), Europe West (Belgium)
- **Azure**: East US, West US 2, West Europe

Each region includes 3 availability zones.

#### Virtual networks (12)

VPCs and VNets across all accounts with various configurations:

- Production VPCs with public and private subnets
- Staging and development networks
- DNS support and hostname configuration

#### Compute instances (19)

Various instance types across all providers:

- Web servers, application servers, database servers
- Linux and Windows instances
- Different instance sizes (t3.large, m5.xlarge, n1-standard-2, Standard_D2s_v3, etc.)

#### Network infrastructure

- Internet gateways for public connectivity
- NAT gateways for private subnet outbound access
- Route tables for traffic routing
- Elastic/static IP addresses
- Network interfaces with security group associations

## Schema architecture

The cloud schema uses a hierarchical structure with clear relationships:

```text
CloudProvider
  └── CloudAccount
        └── CloudVirtualNetwork
              ├── CloudSubnet
              ├── CloudSecurityGroup
              ├── CloudInternetGateway
              └── CloudRouteTable

CloudRegion
  └── CloudAvailabilityZone
        └── CloudInstance
              └── CloudNetworkInterface
```

### Key relationships

- **CloudAccount** belongs to a **CloudProvider** (parent relationship)
- **CloudRegion** is associated with a **CloudProvider**
- **CloudAvailabilityZone** belongs to a **CloudRegion** (parent relationship)
- **CloudVirtualNetwork** is associated with a **CloudAccount** and **CloudRegion**
- **CloudSubnet** belongs to a **CloudVirtualNetwork** (parent relationship)
- **CloudInstance** is associated with a **CloudAccount**, **CloudAvailabilityZone**, and **CloudSubnet**
- **CloudSecurityGroup** can be attached to **CloudInstance** and **CloudNetworkInterface**

### Common attributes

All cloud resources inherit from the `CloudResource` generic, providing:

- `name` - Resource name
- `description` - Optional description
- `cloud_id` - Provider-specific resource identifier (ARN, resource ID, etc.)
- `status` - Operational status (active, stopped, provisioning, terminating, error)
- `tags` - Optional tags for categorization

## Use cases

### Multi-cloud inventory

Use Infrahub as a single source of truth for all cloud resources:

- Track resources across AWS, GCP, and Azure in one place
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Link cloud resources to on-premises infrastructure

### Security auditing

Query security groups and their associations:

- Identify instances with specific security group configurations
- Audit network access rules across all clouds
- Track public IP assignments

### Capacity planning

Analyze compute resources across your cloud footprint:

- Count instances by type, region, or provider
- Track resource utilization patterns
- Plan for growth and optimization

### Network documentation

Document your cloud network architecture:

- Map virtual networks, subnets, and routing
- Track NAT and internet gateway configurations
- Document network interface assignments
