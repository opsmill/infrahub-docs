import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This tutorial walks you through using Infrahub's Service Catalog web interface to manage data center and colocation center deployments. The Service Catalog provides a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit that simplifies infrastructure provisioning by automating branch creation, data loading, and generator execution.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand how to enable the Service Catalog, navigate the interface, view existing infrastructure, and create new data centers through a guided form-based workflow.

## What you'll accomplish

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Enable the Service Catalog container
2. Access the web interface
3. Switch between Infrahub branches
4. View existing data centers and colocation centers
5. Create a new data center using the web form
6. Understand the automated workflow behind the scenes

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed the [installation guide](./install.mdx) and have Infrahub running
- Completed the [user walkthrough](./user-walkthrough.mdx) tutorial
- Docker and Docker Compose installed and configured
- Access to modify environment variables or Docker Compose configuration

:::tip
The Service Catalog is an optional component that simplifies infrastructure provisioning. It's particularly useful for teams who want a web-based interface for infrastructure requests.
:::

## Step 1: enable the service catalog

The Service Catalog runs as a separate Docker container that can be enabled through environment variables or Docker Compose profiles.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="env" label="Environment Variables (Recommended)">

1. Open your `.env` file (or create it from `.env.example`)
2. Set the Service Catalog variable to true:

```bash
INFRAHUB_SERVICE_CATALOG=true
```

3. Restart Infrahub to apply the changes:

```bash
uv run invoke restart
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="profile" label="Docker Compose Profiles">

Start Infrahub with the Service Catalog profile:

```bash
docker-compose --profile service-catalog up -d
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Verify the container is running

Check that the service-catalog container is running:

```bash
docker ps --filter "name=service-catalog"
```

You should see a container named `infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1` or similar in the output.

## Step 2: access the service catalog

Once the container is running, access the Service Catalog web interface:

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8501`
3. The Service Catalog landing page should load

The interface displays:

- **Branch selector** - Dropdown to switch between Infrahub branches
- **Data centers** - List of existing TopologyDataCenter objects
- **Colocation centers** - List of existing TopologyColocationCenter objects
- **Create new data center** - Button to access the DC creation form

:::info
If the page doesn't load, verify the container is running and check the logs with `docker logs infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1`.
:::

## Step 3: switch branches and view infrastructure

The Service Catalog allows you to view infrastructure across different Infrahub branches.

### Switch branches

1. Locate the **branch selector** dropdown at the top of the page
2. Click the dropdown to see all available branches
3. Select a branch (for example, main, add-dc3, etc.)
4. The page will refresh and display infrastructure from the selected branch

### View existing infrastructure

After selecting a branch, you'll see two lists:

#### Data centers

Each data center card displays:

- Data center name (for example, DC-1, DC-2, DC-3)
- Location information
- Link to view in Infrahub UI

#### Colocation centers

Each colocation center card displays:

- Colocation center name (for example, PAR-1, LON-1)
- Location information
- Link to view in Infrahub UI

:::tip
The lists automatically update when you switch branches, allowing you to see infrastructure in different states (main, proposed changes, feature branches).
:::

## Step 4: create a new data center

The Service Catalog provides a guided form for creating new data centers.

### Access the creation form

1. Click the **Create New Data Center** button
2. The form page will load with several input fields

### Fill in the form

Complete each field in the form:

#### 1. Data center name

- Enter a unique name for your data center (for example, DC-6)
- This will be used in the branch name and as the DC identifier

#### 2. Location

- Select a location from the dropdown
- Options include existing LocationBuilding objects (for example, PAR-1, LON-1)
- The location determines where the data center will be deployed

#### 3. Provider

- Select a provider from the dropdown
- Options include existing ProviderNetworkProvider objects
- The provider supplies connectivity and services

#### 4. Design

- Select a design template from the dropdown
- Options include predefined data center architectures
- Different designs support different vendors and topologies

#### 5. Management subnet

- Select an IP prefix for management interfaces
- Used for out-of-band device management
- Choose an available /24 or appropriate size

#### 6. Underlay subnet

- Select an IP prefix for underlay routing
- Used for spine-leaf physical connectivity
- Typically a /24 or /16 depending on DC size

#### 7. Overlay subnet

- Select an IP prefix for overlay services
- Used for VXLAN and EVPN addressing
- Usually a /16 or larger for tenant networks

### Submit the request

1. Review all form fields for accuracy
2. Click the **Submit** button
3. The Service Catalog will display a progress indicator

## Step 5: understand the behind-the-scenes workflow

When you submit the form, the Service Catalog executes an automated workflow that:

### 1. Creates a branch

The Service Catalog creates a new branch in Infrahub with the naming pattern `add-{dc_name}`:

```text
Branch name: add-dc6 (if you named your DC "DC-6")
```

This branch isolates your new infrastructure from the main branch, allowing review before merging.

### 2. Loads data to the branch

The Service Catalog constructs a DesignTopologyDesign YAML object with your form inputs and loads it to the new branch:

```yaml
nodes:
  - kind: DesignTopologyDesign
    data:
      name: DC-6
      location: PAR-1
      provider: provider-1
      design_template: dc-design-template-1
      mgmt_prefix: 10.0.6.0/24
      underlay_prefix: 192.168.6.0/24
      overlay_prefix: 172.16.0.0/16
```

### 3. Waits for the generator

After loading data, the Service Catalog waits for Infrahub's generator to execute:

- Default wait time: 60 seconds (configurable via `GENERATOR_WAIT_TIME`)
- The generator (for example, `create_dc`) processes the design data
- Devices, interfaces, cables, and IP addresses are automatically created

### 4. Creates a proposed change

Once the generator completes, the Service Catalog creates a Proposed Change in Infrahub:

- Compares the new branch to the main branch
- Shows all differences (new devices, interfaces, configurations)
- Allows review before merging to production

### View the results

After the workflow completes:

1. Navigate to **Proposed Changes** in the Infrahub UI (`http://localhost:8000`)
2. Find the proposed change for your DC (for example, "Add DC-6")
3. Review the **Data** tab to see new objects
4. Review the **Artifacts** tab to see generated configurations
5. Approve and merge when ready

:::tip
This workflow demonstrates infrastructure-as-code principles: declarative design data is transformed into imperative implementation through automated generators.

## Troubleshooting

### Service catalog container not starting

If the container fails to start:

1. Check Docker logs:

```bash
docker logs infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1
```

2. Verify environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
INFRAHUB_SERVICE_CATALOG=true
INFRAHUB_ADDRESS=http://infrahub-server:8000
```

3. Ensure Infrahub server is running and accessible:

```bash
docker ps --filter "name=infrahub-server"
```

### Cannot access http://localhost:8501

If the web interface doesn't load:

1. Verify port 8501 is not in use by another application
2. Check container port mapping:

```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}" --filter "name=service-catalog"
```

3. Try accessing via container IP directly:

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1
```

### Branch selector is empty

If no branches appear in the dropdown:

1. Verify Infrahub server connection from the container:

```bash
docker exec infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1 curl http://infrahub-server:8000/api/schema
```

2. Check that branches exist in Infrahub:

```bash
uv run infrahubctl branch list
```

3. Review Service Catalog logs for API errors:

```bash
docker logs infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1 | grep -i error
```

### Generator timeout errors

If DC creation fails with timeout errors:

1. Increase the wait time in `.env`:

```bash
GENERATOR_WAIT_TIME=120  # Increase to 120 seconds
```

2. Check generator status in Infrahub UI under **Task Management**
3. Verify generator definition is registered in `.infrahub.yml`

### Form submission fails

If the submit button doesn't work:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 → Console)
2. Verify all required fields are filled
3. Check that selected options (location, provider, design) exist in Infrahub
4. Review Service Catalog logs during submission:

```bash
docker logs -f infrahub-bundle-dc-service-catalog-1
```

## Advanced usage

### Custom default branch

Change the default branch shown in the branch selector:

```bash
# In .env
DEFAULT_BRANCH=production
```

### Adjust timeouts

Tune timeouts for your environment:

```bash
# In .env
GENERATOR_WAIT_TIME=90  # Generator execution wait
API_TIMEOUT=30          # API request timeout
API_RETRY_COUNT=3       # API retry attempts
```

### Integration with CI/CD

The Service Catalog workflow can be automated via API:

1. POST form data to Service Catalog endpoint
2. Wait for branch creation
3. Run validation checks
4. Auto-approve proposed changes if checks pass

This enables self-service infrastructure provisioning with approval gates.
