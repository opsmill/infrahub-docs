title: Deploy a virtual lab with Containerlab
---

This tutorial walks you through deploying a virtual data center topology using Containerlab. You'll take the configurations generated by Infrahub and spin up a fully functional network lab with Arista cEOS virtual switches.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a running virtual data center that you can access, test, and validate before deploying to production hardware.

## What you'll accomplish

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Generate a data center topology with Arista switches
2. Extract device configurations and topology files from Infrahub
3. Deploy the virtual lab using Containerlab
4. Verify the deployment and access virtual devices

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed the [installation guide](./install.mdx) and have Infrahub running
- Completed the [user walkthrough](./user-walkthrough.mdx) to understand the basic workflow
- **Docker** installed and running with sufficient resources (at least 16GB RAM recommended to support a few cEOS containers)
- **Containerlab** installed ([installation instructions](https://containerlab.dev/install/))
- **sudo access** for running Containerlab (required for network namespace operations)

:::info
This tutorial builds on the user walkthrough. You must complete the basic workflow (creating branches, loading designs, running generators) before deploying to Containerlab.
:::

## Understanding the workflow

The Containerlab deployment workflow connects Infrahub's generated artifacts to a virtual lab environment:

```text
Infrahub Data → Generator → Artifacts → Containerlab Deployment
                                ↓
                    Config Files + Topology File
                                ↓
                    Virtual Network Lab (cEOS)
```

**Key components:**

- **Generated configurations** - Device startup configs extracted from Infrahub artifacts
- **Containerlab topology file** - YAML definition of virtual lab including device connections
- **cEOS images** - Arista Container EOS virtual switches
- **Containerlab** - Network lab orchestration tool that creates Docker containers with proper network connectivity

## Step 1: generate the Arista data center topology

Use the automated demo command to create a complete Arista data center in Infrahub:

```bash
uv run invoke demo-dc-arista
```

This command:

1. Creates a new branch `add-dc3`
2. Loads the DC-3 Arista design (`objects/dc/dc-arista-s.yml`)
3. Returns immediately after loading (generator runs asynchronously)

### Wait for generator completion

The generator runs automatically in the background. Monitor its progress:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Switch to the `add-dc3` branch using the branch selector
3. Go to **System → Tasks** in the left sidebar
4. Find the `create_dc` generator task
5. Wait for status to change from "Pending" → "Running" → "Completed"

Generator execution typically takes 2-3 minutes as it creates devices, interfaces, IP addresses, and routing configurations.

:::tip
While waiting, you can review the design parameters at **Network Topologies → Deployments → Data center → DC-3** to see what will be created.
:::

## Step 2: Create a proposed change and merge

Before extracting configurations, merge the topology to the main branch:

1. Navigate to **Proposed Changes**
2. Click **New Proposed Change**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `Add DC-3 Arista data center`
   - **Source Branch**: `add-dc3`
   - **Destination Branch**: `main`
   - **Description**: `Deploy DC-3 with Arista switches for Containerlab testing`
4. Click **Create Proposed Change**
5. Review validations and artifacts
6. Click **Merge** once all checks pass

:::info
You can also extract configurations from the branch without merging, but merging ensures the topology is validated and ready for production use.
:::

## Step 3: Extract configurations and topology files

Run the containerlab deployment command:

```bash
uv run invoke containerlab
```

This command performs two operations:

### Operation 1: Extract artifacts from Infrahub

The invoke task runs `uv run scripts/get_configs.py --branch add-dc3` which:

- Queries Infrahub for all artifacts in the specified branch
- Downloads device configurations (startup configs for each switch)
- Downloads the Containerlab topology file
- Saves everything to the `generated-configs/` directory

**Directory structure created:**

```text
generated-configs/
├── clab/
│   └── DC-3.clab.yml       # Containerlab topology definition
└── devices/
    ├── dc3-spine1.cfg      # Spine switch configurations
    ├── dc3-spine2.cfg
    ├── dc3-leaf1.cfg       # Leaf switch configurations
    ├── dc3-leaf2.cfg
    ├── dc3-leaf3.cfg
    ├── dc3-leaf4.cfg
    ├── dc3-border-leaf1.cfg  # Border leaf configurations
    └── dc3-border-leaf2.cfg
```

### Operation 2: Deploy with Containerlab

The invoke task then runs `sudo -E containerlab deploy -t generated-configs/clab/DC-3.clab.yml` which:

- Reads the topology definition file
- Pulls the Arista cEOS Docker image from the OpsMill artifact repository
- Creates Docker containers for each device
- Configures virtual network connections between devices
- Loads the generated startup configurations into each device
- Starts all devices

:::info
The Containerlab topology file references a cEOS Docker image hosted in the OpsMill artifact repository. On first deployment, Docker will download this image (approximately 500MB). The generated configurations are automatically loaded into each cEOS container during instantiation via Containerlab's startup-configuration mechanism.
:::

### Monitor deployment progress

Watch the console output as Containerlab:

1. Creates the lab directory
2. Creates network links between devices
3. Creates containers for each device
4. Loads configurations into devices
5. Waits for devices to boot

Deployment typically takes 2-4 minutes depending on your system and whether the Docker image is cached.

## Step 4: Verify the deployment

Once deployment completes, verify the virtual lab is running:

### Check container status

```bash
sudo containerlab inspect --name DC-3
```

You should see output showing all devices with their management IP addresses and states.

### List running containers

```bash
docker ps --filter "label=containerlab=DC-3"
```

All device containers should show as "Up" with healthy status.

### Check device connectivity

```bash
# List all Containerlab labs
sudo containerlab inspect --all

# Show detailed topology
sudo containerlab graph --name DC-3
```

## Step 5: Access virtual devices

Connect to any device in your virtual lab using the Containerlab CLI:

### Connect to a spine switch

```bash
sudo containerlab exec --name DC-3 --node dc3-spine1 Cli
```

This drops you into the Arista EOS CLI. Try some commands:

```bash
# Check device hostname and version
show version

# Verify interfaces are up
show ip interface brief

# Check BGP neighbors
show ip bgp summary

# View running configuration
show running-config
```

Type `exit` to return to your shell.

### Connect to a leaf switch

```bash
sudo containerlab exec --name DC-3 --node dc3-leaf1 Cli
```

Verify the leaf's connectivity to spines:

```bash
# Check BGP neighbors (should see both spines)
show ip bgp summary

# Check VXLAN configuration
show vxlan vtep

# Verify EVPN routes
show bgp evpn summary
```

### Connect to devices with SSH

Containerlab also provides SSH access to devices. Find the management IPs:

```bash
sudo containerlab inspect --name DC-3
```

Then SSH using the displayed IP addresses:

```bash
ssh admin@<management-ip>
```

Default credentials are typically `admin` / `admin` for cEOS devices.

## Step 6: Destroy the lab (cleanup)

When you're done testing, destroy the lab to free resources:

```bash
sudo containerlab destroy --name DC-3
```

This command:

- Stops all containers
- Removes containers and networks
- Cleans up Containerlab state
- Preserves the configuration files in `generated-configs/`

:::tip
The generated configuration files remain in `generated-configs/` even after destroying the lab. This allows you to redeploy quickly or version control your configs.

## What you've learned

Congratulations! You've completed the Containerlab deployment workflow:

- ✅ Generated a multi-vendor data center topology in Infrahub
- ✅ Extracted device configurations and topology files
- ✅ Deployed a virtual network lab with Containerlab
- ✅ Verified device connectivity and routing protocols
- ✅ Accessed and tested virtual devices
- ✅ Cleaned up lab resources

## Advanced usage

### Using different branches

Deploy configurations from any branch:

```bash
uv run invoke containerlab --branch my-branch --topology DC-3
```

### Testing configuration changes

Use this workflow to test changes before production:

1. Create a branch in Infrahub
2. Modify device configurations or topology
3. Run generator
4. Extract configs and deploy to Containerlab
5. Test in virtual lab
6. If successful, merge to main and deploy to production

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment fails with "permission denied"

Ensure you're using `sudo` for Containerlab commands:

```bash
sudo -E containerlab deploy -t generated-configs/clab/DC-3.clab.yml
```

The `-E` flag preserves environment variables (important for Docker access).

### Docker image pull fails

If the cEOS image pull fails, verify:

1. Docker is running and you have internet connectivity
2. You have sufficient disk space (at least 2GB free)
3. You can access the OpsMill artifact repository

### Devices don't boot or configurations aren't loaded

Check container logs:

```bash
docker logs clab-DC-3-dc3-spine1
```

Look for configuration syntax errors or boot failures.

### Out of memory errors

Containerlab labs can be resource-intensive. For DC-3 with 8 devices:

- Minimum: 4GB RAM
- Recommended: 8GB RAM
- Optimal: 16GB RAM

Reduce device count or increase Docker's memory allocation if needed.
