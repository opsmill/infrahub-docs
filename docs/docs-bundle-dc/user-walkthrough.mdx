This tutorial guides you through the complete workflow of creating a data center topology using Infrahub's design-driven automation. You'll create a new branch, load a topology design, run a generator to create infrastructure, review the changes, and merge them to the main branch.

By the end of this walkthrough, you'll understand how to use Infrahub's branch-based workflow to safely design, validate, and deploy network infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- Completed the [installation guide](./install.mdx) and have Infrahub running
- Loaded the bootstrap data and schemas
- Access to the Infrahub web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

## What you'll accomplish

In this tutorial, you will:

1. Create a new branch for your changes
2. Load a data center design (DC-3)
3. Wait for the automatic generator to create devices, interfaces, and connections
4. Create a proposed change
5. Review the generated artifacts and validation results
6. Merge the changes to the main branch

## Step 1: Create a new branch

All changes in Infrahub happen in branches. This allows you to work on infrastructure changes safely without affecting the main branch until you're ready.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="web" label="Web Interface">

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
2. Click on the branch selector in the top-right corner (shows "main" by default)
3. Click **Create Branch**
4. Enter branch name: `add-dc3`
5. Click **Create**

You should see a success message confirming the branch was created.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Create the branch from the command line:

```bash
uv run infrahubctl branch create add-dc3
```

You should see a success message confirming the branch was created.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Branch names should be descriptive and indicate what changes you're making, like `add-dc3`, `update-security-policies`, or `fix-bgp-config`.
:::

## Step 2: Switch to your new branch

In the web interface:

1. Click the branch selector in the top-right
2. Select `add-dc3` from the list
3. The interface should now show `add-dc3` as the active branch

:::info
All subsequent actions will be performed on the `add-dc3` branch until you switch back to another branch.
:::

## Step 3: load the DC-3 design

The DC-3 design is a pre-configured data center topology specification that defines:

- A data center named "DC-3"
- Spine-leaf fabric architecture
- Device roles and platform assignments
- IP address pools and subnets
- BGP autonomous system configuration

Load the design data onto your branch:

```bash
uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-arista-s.yml --branch add-dc3
```

Watch the output for success messages. You should see confirmations that the topology data has been loaded.

### Verify the design loaded

In the web interface:

1. Ensure you're on the `add-dc3` branch
2. Navigate to **Network Topologies → Deployments → Data center**
3. You should see a new entry for **DC-3**
4. Click on DC-3 to view its properties

The design specifies high-level parameters like:

- Data center name and location
- Number of spines and leaves
- Underlay routing protocol (eBGP or OSPF)
- Addressing schemes

### Multi-vendor support

This demo supports multiple network device vendors with pre-configured data center designs. The DC-3 topology you just loaded uses Arista EOS switches, but the demo can generate configurations for several other vendors.

**Available vendor designs:**

- **Arista EOS** - The default DC-3 design with Arista switches (`objects/dc/dc-arista-s.yml`)
- **Cisco NX-OS** - The DC-2 design (`objects/dc/dc-cisco-s.yml`)
- **Juniper JunOS** - DC-5 design with Juniper switches
- **SONiC NOS** - DC-4 design with EdgeCore switches running SONiC

**Using alternative vendor designs:**

To explore Arista EOS configurations, you can use the automated demo command:

```bash
uv run invoke demo-dc-arista
```

This command creates a branch, loads the Arista design, waits for generator completion, then creates a proposed change.

For other vendors, load the design files directly:

```bash
# Juniper design (DC-5)
uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-juniper-s.yml --branch add-dc5

# SONiC design (DC-4)
uv run infrahubctl object load objects/dc/dc-sonic-border-leafs.yml --branch add-dc4
```

Each vendor design generates appropriate configurations for that platform's CLI syntax and features. The same workflow (branch creation, design loading, generator execution, proposed change, merge) applies regardless of vendor.

## Step 4: Wait for automatic generator execution

When you loaded the DC-3 design in Step 3, Infrahub automatically triggered a generator action that transforms the abstract design into concrete infrastructure objects including devices, interfaces, IP addresses, and routing configurations.

This automation is configured through an event action (defined in `objects/events/98_generator_action.yml`) that runs the `create_dc` generator whenever a data center topology is created or updated.

### Monitor generator progress

Generator execution can take several minutes as it creates hundreds of objects. Monitor the task status:

1. Navigate to **System → Tasks** in the left sidebar
2. Find your generator task in the list (look for `create_dc`)
3. Watch the status change from "Pending" to "Running" to "Completed"

:::info
Generator actions are event-driven automations configured in Infrahub. When you load a data center topology object, the event system automatically triggers the `create_dc` generator. This eliminates the need for manual generator execution and ensures consistency across deployments.
:::

:::tip
Generators create infrastructure following best practices. For DC-3, the create_dc generator will create spine switches, leaf switches, border leafs, management connections, fabric peering, loopback interfaces, and BGP configurations.
:::

## Step 5: Review generated infrastructure

Once the generator completes, explore what was created:

### View devices

1. Navigate to **Device Management → Infrastructure → All Devices**
2. You should see multiple devices created:
   - Spine switches (typically 2 or more)
   - Leaf switches (typically 4 or more)
   - Border leaf switches (typically 2)

### View interfaces

Click on any device to see its details including:

- Physical and loopback interfaces
- IP addresses assigned to each interface
- Interface descriptions and roles

### View IP prefixes

Navigate to **IP Address Management → IP Prefixes** to see:

- Management network prefixes
- Loopback prefixes
- Underlay point-to-point link prefixes

### View routing

Navigate to **Routing** sections to see:

- BGP peer groups
- BGP sessions between spines and leaves
- Autonomous system assignments

## Step 6: Create a proposed change

Now that you've made changes on your branch, create a proposed change to merge them into main. Proposed changes provide a review mechanism with diffs, validation checks, and artifact generation.

### Create the proposed change

1. Navigate to **Proposed Changes**
2. Click **New Proposed Change**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `Add DC-3 data center`
   - **Source Branch**: `add-dc3`
   - **Destination Branch**: `main`
   - **Description** (optional): `This change adds the DC-3 data center with spine-leaf fabric`
4. Click **Create Proposed Change**

### Understanding what happens next

When you create a proposed change, Infrahub automatically:

- Creates a diff showing all objects added, modified, or deleted
- Runs validation checks defined in your checks
- Regenerates all artifacts affected by the changes
- Runs repository checks if configured

## Step 7: Review validations and artifacts

Navigate to your proposed change to review the results:

### View the diff

1. Click on the **Files** or **Diff** tab
2. Review all the objects that will be created when you merge
3. You should see hundreds of additions including:
   - Devices
   - Interfaces
   - IP addresses
   - BGP configurations
   - Routing protocols

### Check validation results

1. Click on the **Checks** or **Validations** tab
2. Review the validation results
3. All checks should pass with a green checkmark
4. If any checks fail, review the error messages and fix issues before merging

Common validations include:

- **Spine connectivity checks** - Verify all spines are properly connected
- **Leaf connectivity checks** - Verify all leaves are connected to all spines
- **IP address uniqueness** - Ensure no duplicate IP assignments
- **BGP configuration** - Validate BGP peer groups and sessions

### View generated artifacts

1. Click on the **Artifacts** tab
2. You should see generated artifacts including:
   - **Device configurations** (one per device)
     - Spine, leaf, and border-leaf configurations in native vendor CLI format
     - For Arista and Juniper leaf switches, additional OpenConfig-formatted configurations demonstrating multi-format output
   - **Topology cabling matrix** (CSV format) - Complete cabling plan with source/destination interfaces
   - **Containerlab topology file** - Virtual lab topology definition for testing configurations

Click on any artifact to view its content. For example, view a spine configuration to see the generated CLI commands.

**Multi-format configuration rendering:**

Infrahub's transformation system can generate multiple configuration formats from the same source data. For Arista EOS and Juniper JunOS leaf switches, you'll find both:

- **Native CLI format** - Vendor-specific command syntax ready for deployment
- **OpenConfig format** - Standardized, vendor-neutral YANG-based configuration

This demonstrates how a single data model in Infrahub can produce multiple output formats, enabling flexibility in deployment methods (traditional CLI, NETCONF, gNMI, etc.) without duplicating source data.

**Infrastructure artifacts:**

Beyond device configurations, the generator creates supporting artifacts:

- **CSV cabling matrix** - Documents physical connectivity between all devices and interfaces, useful for operations teams during installation and troubleshooting
- **Containerlab topology file** - Enables spinning up virtual lab environments that mirror your production topology for testing and validation

:::tip
Artifacts are regenerated automatically when you create a proposed change. This ensures they always reflect the latest data.
:::

## Step 8: Merge the proposed change

Once you've reviewed everything and all validations pass, you're ready to merge:

1. In the proposed change view, click the **Merge** button
2. Confirm the merge in the dialog
3. Wait for the merge task to complete

The merge process:

- Applies all changes from the source branch to the destination branch
- Runs any post-merge hooks or actions
- Updates the main branch with your new infrastructure

### Verify the merge

1. Switch back to the **main** branch using the branch selector
2. Navigate to **Device Management → Infrastructure → All Devices**
3. You should now see all the DC-3 devices in the main branch
4. Navigate to **Services → Topology Deployments → Data center**
5. Verify that DC-3 appears in the main branch

## Step 9: View device configurations

Now that DC-3 is in the main branch, view the generated device configurations:

1. Ensure you're on the **main** branch
2. Navigate to **Device Management → Infrastructure → All Devices**
3. Click on a spine device (for example, `dc3-spine1`)
4. Look for an **Artifacts** section or tab
5. Click on the spine configuration artifact

You should see a complete device configuration including:

- Interface configurations
- IP addressing
- BGP configuration
- OSPF configuration (if using OSPF underlay)
- VxLAN EVPN configuration
