title: How to backup your Infrahub instance

This guide walks you through creating a comprehensive backup of your Infrahub instance. If you need to protect your data, prepare for upgrades, or establish disaster recovery procedures, follow these steps to create reliable backups.

## Community Edition support

Infrahub Community Edition deployments are fully supported by `infrahub-backup`, but there are a few operational differences to plan for compared to Enterprise environments.

:::warning
Backing up Community Edition stops the Infrahub application container while the snapshot is taken. Schedule the command during a maintenance window to avoid user-facing downtime.
:::

Restoring a backup that was taken from an Enterprise cluster to a Community Edition instance is not supported. Create and maintain backups from the same edition you intend to restore to.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a backup:

- Ensure infrahub-backup is installed and configured
- Verify you have sufficient disk space (at least 2x your database size)
- Have write permissions to the backup directory
- Confirm your Infrahub instance is accessible

## Step 1: Check for running tasks

Before initiating a backup, check if there are active tasks that might be interrupted by checking the Infrahub web interface or waiting for natural completion.

If tasks are running, you have two options:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="wait" label="Wait for Completion" default>

Wait for tasks to complete naturally by monitoring the Infrahub UI, then proceed with backup:

```bash
infrahub-backup create
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="force" label="Force Backup">

Force backup despite running tasks:

```bash
# Force backup (running tasks will be ignored)
infrahub-backup create --force
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create the backup

Execute the backup command with your desired options:

### Basic backup

For a standard backup with all components:

```bash
infrahub-backup create
```

### Selective metadata backup

Control which Neo4j metadata to include:

```bash
# Backup without metadata (smallest size)
infrahub-backup create --neo4jmetadata=none

# Backup with only user accounts
infrahub-backup create --neo4jmetadata=users

# Backup with only roles
infrahub-backup create --neo4jmetadata=roles

# Backup with everything (default)
infrahub-backup create --neo4jmetadata=all
```

### Custom backup location

Specify an alternative backup directory:

```bash
infrahub-backup create --backup-dir=/mnt/backups/infrahub
```

### Target specific project

If running multiple Infrahub instances:

```bash
infrahub-backup create --project=infrahub-production
```

## Step 3: Monitor backup progress

The backup process provides detailed progress information:

```bash
INFO[0000] Starting backup process...
INFO[0000] Checking for running tasks...
INFO[0001] No running tasks found
INFO[0001] Creating backup ID: 20250929_143022
INFO[0002] Stopping Infrahub application containers...
INFO[0005] Application containers stopped
INFO[0005] Backing up Neo4j database...
INFO[0015] Neo4j backup completed (1.2GB)
INFO[0015] Backing up PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0018] PostgreSQL backup completed (256MB)
INFO[0020] Creating compressed archive...
INFO[0025] Archive created: infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
INFO[0025] Starting application containers...
INFO[0030] All containers started successfully
INFO[0030] Backup completed successfully
```

## Step 4: Verify backup integrity

After backup completion, verify the backup file:

### Check backup file

```bash
# List backup files with sizes
ls -lh infrahub_backups/

# Verify archive integrity
tar -tzf infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz > /dev/null && echo "Archive is valid"

# View backup metadata
tar -xzOf infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz backup_information.json | jq '.'
```

### Validate backup contents

The backup should contain:

- `backup_information.json` - Backup information and checksums
- `database/` - Neo4j database files
- `prefect.dump` - PostgreSQL dump

Example metadata structure:

```json
{
  "metadata_version": 2025092500,
  "backup_id": "20250929_143022",
  "created_at": "2025-09-29T14:30:22Z",
  "tool_version": "1.0.0",
  "infrahub_version": "0.15.0",
  "components": ["database", "task-manager-db"],
  "checksums": {
    "database": "sha256:abc123...",
    "prefect.dump": "sha256:def456..."
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Backup artifact storage

Capture any artifact storage (object stores, shared volumes, artifact registries) that Infrahub references during task execution. Align the snapshot timing with the database backup so the two stay consistent.

- Identify the storage location configured for your task manager (bucket, container, or filesystem path).
- Copy or synchronize the artifacts into a dated folder or snapshot using the native tooling for your storage provider.
- Record the snapshot path or version ID alongside your database backup metadata so operators can retrieve the artifacts during a restore.

If your storage tier already offers automatic versioning or replication, confirm the retention window meets your recovery objectives and document how to retrieve the relevant versions during a disaster scenario.

## Step 6: Test restore capability

Periodically test restoration to ensure backups are valid:

```bash
# Review what would be restored
infrahub-backup restore infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
```

## Advanced usage

### Automated backups with cron

Create a cron job for regular backups:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/infrahub-backup create >> /var/log/infrahub-backup.log 2>&1

# With retention management (keep 7 days)
0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/infrahub-backup create && find /path/to/backups -name "*.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete
```

### Backup with notification

Create a wrapper script for notifications:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
BACKUP_RESULT=$(infrahub-backup create 2>&1)
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup successful" | mail -s "Infrahub Backup Success" ops@example.com
else
    echo "$BACKUP_RESULT" | mail -s "Infrahub Backup Failed" ops@example.com
    exit 1
fi
```

### Remote backup storage

After local backup, transfer to remote storage:

```bash
# Backup locally first
infrahub-backup create

# Transfer to remote storage
LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t infrahub_backups/*.tar.gz | head -1)

# S3 example
aws s3 cp "$LATEST_BACKUP" s3://my-bucket/infrahub-backups/

# SCP example
scp "$LATEST_BACKUP" backup-server:/backups/infrahub/

# Rsync example
rsync -avz "$LATEST_BACKUP" backup-server:/backups/infrahub/
```

## Validation

Confirm your backup strategy works:

- ✓ Backup completes without errors
- ✓ Archive passes integrity check
- ✓ Metadata contains expected components
- ✓ File size is reasonable for your data volume
- ✓ Test restore succeeds in non-production environment
