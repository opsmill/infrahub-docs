This guide shows you how to restore your Infrahub instance from a backup file. If you need to recover from data loss, roll back changes, or migrate to new infrastructure, follow these steps to safely restore your system.

## Community Edition compatibility

Restores are supported for Infrahub Community Edition when the backup was created from the same edition. Enterprise backups include components that are not available in Community Edition and cannot be restored.

:::danger
Restoring an Enterprise backup to a Community Edition deployment is not supported. Always use backups that were captured from the same edition you plan to restore.
:::

## Prerequisites

Before restoring from backup:

- Have a valid backup file created by infrahub-backup
- Ensure sufficient disk space for extraction (3x backup size)
- Stop all write operations to the current instance
- Verify you have necessary permissions
- **Create a current backup** before overwriting existing data

:::danger
Restoration replaces all existing data. Always verify you have a current backup before proceeding with a restore operation.
:::

## Step 1: Prepare for restoration


### Create safety backup

Before overwriting current data, create a safety backup:

```bash
# Backup current state
infrahub-backup create --backup-dir=/tmp/safety-backup

# Note the filename for potential recovery
SAFETY_BACKUP=$(ls -t /tmp/safety-backup/*.tar.gz | head -1)
echo "Safety backup: $SAFETY_BACKUP"
```

## Step 2: Execute the restore

### Basic restore

Restore from a backup file:

```bash
infrahub-backup restore infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
```

The restore process will:

1. Validate backup compatibility
2. Stop all Infrahub containers
3. Clear existing data
4. Restore Neo4j database
5. Restore PostgreSQL task manager
6. Restart all services

### Restore to specific project

If you have multiple Infrahub projects:

```bash
# Restore to a specific Docker Compose project
infrahub-backup restore infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz --project=infrahub-staging
```

## Step 3: Monitor restoration progress

Watch the detailed restoration output:

```bash
INFO[0000] Starting restore process...
INFO[0000] Reading backup metadata...
INFO[0001] Backup created: 2025-09-29T14:30:22Z
INFO[0001] Backup version: 1.0.0
INFO[0001] Validating backup compatibility...
INFO[0002] Validation successful
INFO[0002] Stopping all Infrahub containers...
INFO[0008] All containers stopped
INFO[0008] Extracting backup archive...
INFO[0012] Archive extracted successfully
INFO[0012] Restoring Neo4j database...
INFO[0025] Neo4j database restored
INFO[0025] Restoring PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0030] PostgreSQL database restored
INFO[0032] Starting Infrahub containers...
INFO[0040] All containers started
INFO[0040] Restore completed successfully
```

## Step 4: Verify restoration

### Check service health

Verify all services are running:

```bash
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# All containers should show "Up" status
# Example output:
# NAME                    IMAGE                      STATUS
# infrahub-server         opsmill/infrahub:stable    Up 2 minutes
# database                neo4j:5.13                 Up 2 minutes
# task-manager-db         postgres:15                Up 2 minutes
```

### Test application access

Confirm Infrahub is accessible:

```bash
# Test HTTP endpoint
curl -I http://localhost:8000

# Check GraphQL endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "{ InfrahubInfo { version } }"}'
```

### Validate data integrity

Verify your data was restored correctly:

1. Log into the Infrahub web interface
2. Check that your schemas are present
3. Verify critical data objects exist
4. Test a few key queries or operations
5. Review recent task history

## Step 5: Post-restoration tasks


### Verify integrations

Check external integrations are working:

- Git repositories sync correctly
- External authentication (LDAP/SSO) functions
- Webhook endpoints are accessible
- API integrations reconnect properly


## Validation

Confirm restoration was successful:

- ✓ All services are running
- ✓ Web interface is accessible
- ✓ Data appears complete and correct
- ✓ Authentication works
- ✓ Background tasks are processing
- ✓ Integrations are functional
