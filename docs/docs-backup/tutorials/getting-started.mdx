This tutorial walks you through your first experience with Infrahub Backup, teaching you the fundamentals by creating a backup of your Infrahub instance and then restoring it. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the basic workflow and be confident in using `infrahub-backup` for essential maintenance tasks.

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll:

- Install infrahub-backup on your system
- Detect your Infrahub deployment environment
- Create your first backup
- Verify the backup was successful
- Capture a snapshot of artifact storage alongside database backups
- Restore from the backup you created

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- A running Infrahub instance (using Docker Compose)
- Docker installed and running on your system
- Terminal access with sudo privileges
- At least 1GB of free disk space for backups

## Step 1: Install infrahub-backup

First, install the infrahub-backup tool. The recommended method is to download binaries:

```bash
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/ops/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/infrahub-backup -o infrahub-backup

chmod +x infrahub-backup

# Verify installation
./infrahub-backup version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
Version: 1.0.0
```

## Step 2: Detect your environment

Before performing any operations, verify that infrahub-backup can detect your Infrahub deployment:

```bash
./infrahub-backup environment detect
```

Expected output:

```bash
INFO[0000] Detecting deployment environment...
INFO[0000] Docker environment detected
INFO[0000] Found Docker Compose project: infrahub
```

If you have multiple Infrahub projects, list them all:

```bash
./infrahub-backup environment list
```

This shows all available Docker Compose projects running Infrahub.

## Step 3: Create your first backup

Now, let's create a backup of your Infrahub instance. This operation will:

1. Check for running tasks
2. Backup the Neo4j database
3. Backup the PostgreSQL task manager database
4. Create a compressed archive

Run the backup command:

```bash
./infrahub-backup create
```

You'll see detailed progress output:

```bash
INFO[0000] Starting backup process...
INFO[0000] Checking for running tasks...
INFO[0001] No running tasks found
INFO[0004] Backing up Neo4j database...
INFO[0010] Neo4j backup completed
INFO[0010] Backing up PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0012] PostgreSQL backup completed
INFO[0012] Creating backup archive...
INFO[0015] Backup created successfully: infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
INFO[0015] Starting application containers...
INFO[0020] Backup process completed
```

:::note
The backup file is stored in the `infrahub_backups` directory by default. Note the filename for the restore step.
:::

## Step 4: Verify your backup

Check that your backup was created successfully:

```bash
# List backup files
ls -lh infrahub_backups/

# View backup contents (without extracting)
tar -tzf infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_*.tar.gz | head -10
```

You should see:

- A `.tar.gz` file with today's timestamp
- Inside the archive: `backup_information.json`, database files, and other components

## Step 5: Capture artifact storage

If your Infrahub workflows produce artifacts stored outside the databases, take a moment to snapshot that storage so the backup remains consistent. Identify the bucket, container, or volume where artifacts live and copy the contents into a dated folder or version. Use your provider’s native tooling (for example, `aws s3 sync`, `az storage blob download`, or `rsync` for shared volumes) and note where you stored the snapshot so you can pair it with the database backup when restoring.

If using standard docker compose deployment:

```bash
# Copy artifacts directory to backup location
docker compose cp -a infrahub-server:/opt/infrahub/storage /backup/artifacts/
```

## Step 6: Restore from backup

To complete the learning cycle, let's restore from the backup you just created. This simulates recovering from a disaster or rolling back changes.

:::warning
Restoring will replace all current data in your Infrahub instance. In a production environment, always verify you have a current backup before restoring an older one.
:::

```bash
# Replace with your actual backup filename
./infrahub-backup restore infrahub_backups/infrahub_backup_20250929_143022.tar.gz
```

The restore process will:

1. Validate the backup file
2. Stop all containers
3. Restore the Neo4j database
4. Restore the PostgreSQL database
5. Restart all services

Expected output:

```bash
INFO[0000] Starting restore process...
INFO[0000] Validating backup file...
INFO[0001] Backup validation successful
INFO[0001] Stopping all containers...
INFO[0005] Restoring Neo4j database...
INFO[0015] Neo4j restore completed
INFO[0015] Restoring PostgreSQL database...
INFO[0018] PostgreSQL restore completed
INFO[0018] Starting all containers...
INFO[0025] Restore completed successfully
```

## Step 7: Verify the restore

Confirm your Infrahub instance is running correctly:

```bash
# Check container status
docker compose ps

# Test Infrahub connectivity (adjust URL as needed)
curl -I http://localhost:8080
```

All containers should be in the "Up" state, and the HTTP request should return a successful response.

## What you've learned

Congratulations! You've completed your first backup and restore cycle with Infrahub Backup. You now know how to:

- Install and verify infrahub-backup
- Detect your deployment environment
- Create comprehensive backups of your Infrahub instance
- Capture artifact storage snapshots to keep backups complete
- Restore from a backup file
- Verify successful operations

## Next steps

Now that you understand the basics, explore:

- [How to backup your Infrahub instance](../guides/backup-instance.mdx)
- [How to restore from backup](../guides/restore-backup.mdx)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

**Permission denied when running commands:**

- Ensure your user has Docker permissions: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
- Log out and back in for changes to take effect

**Cannot detect environment:**

- Verify Docker is running: `docker ps`
- Check Docker Compose is installed: `docker compose version`

**Backup fails with "running tasks detected":**

- Wait for tasks to complete, or use `--force` flag to proceed anyway
- Check task status in Infrahub UI
