title: How to Install the Service Catalog Demo
description: Set up the Service Catalog demo environment with Infrahub and Streamlit to enable self-service network provisioning.

import ReferenceLink from "../../src/components/Card";

This guide walks you through installing the Service Catalog demo, which demonstrates how to build a self-service portal on top of Infrahub's source of truth system. By the end of this guide, you'll have a working environment where users can request network services through a web interface.

## What you'll achieve

After completing this installation:

- **Infrahub instance** running with network infrastructure data
- **Service Catalog portal** accessible for requesting services
- **Demo data** loaded including locations, devices, and network resources
- **Git integration** configured for infrastructure as code workflows

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have these tools installed:

### Required software

- 🐳 **Docker**: Container runtime for running Infrahub and its dependencies
    - [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) for local development
    - Or Docker Engine on a Linux VM for server deployments
    - Minimum 4GB RAM allocated to Docker

- 🐍 **Poetry**: Python dependency management tool
    - Install via the [official installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs)
    - Used to manage Python packages and virtual environments
    - Version 1.2.0 or higher recommended

### System requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2
- **Memory**: At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 10GB free disk space
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloading dependencies

## Installation steps

### Step 1: Clone the repository

First, download the demo code from GitHub. This repository contains all the necessary configuration files, schemas, and demo data.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-service-catalog.git
cd infrahub-demo-service-catalog
```

:::tip What's in the Repository?
The repository includes:

- **Infrahub schemas** defining the data models for network infrastructure
- **Demo data** with sample locations, devices, and network resources
- **Service Catalog application** built with Streamlit
- **Docker configuration** for running all components
:::

### Step 2: Configure environment variables

Set up the connection details for Infrahub. These variables tell the Service Catalog application how to communicate with the Infrahub API.

```shell
export INFRAHUB_ADDRESS="http://localhost:8000"
export INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN="06438eb2-8019-4776-878c-0941b1f1d1ec"
```

#### Understanding the variables

- **`INFRAHUB_ADDRESS`**: The URL where Infrahub's API is accessible
    - Default uses `localhost:8000` for local development
    - Change this if running Infrahub on a different host or port

- **`INFRAHUB_API_TOKEN`**: Authentication token for API access
    - The demo uses a pre-configured token for convenience
    - In production, use secure token generation and storage

### Step 3: Install Python dependencies

Use Poetry to create a virtual environment and install all required Python packages.

```shell
poetry install
```

This command:

- Creates an isolated Python virtual environment
- Installs the Infrahub SDK for API interactions
- Installs Streamlit for the web portal interface
- Sets up development tools (pytest, ruff, ty)

:::note First Time Using Poetry?
Poetry automatically manages virtual environments. All subsequent commands should be run with `poetry run` prefix to ensure they use the correct environment.
:::

### Step 4: Start the application stack

Launch Infrahub and the Service Catalog using Docker Compose. This single command starts multiple services.

```shell
poetry run invoke start
```

:::important Why Use Invoke?
The `invoke start` command is a wrapper that:

- Ensures the correct Docker Compose configuration is used
- Mounts the `service_catalog` module into the Infrahub container
- Starts both Infrahub and the Streamlit application
- Sets up networking between containers
:::

#### What gets started

This command launches:

- **Infrahub Core**: The main application server (port 8000)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing infrastructure data
- **Redis**: Cache and message broker
- **RabbitMQ**: Task queue for asynchronous operations
- **Service Catalog**: Streamlit web portal (port 8501)

### Step 5: Configure Git integration

Connect the demo repository to Infrahub for infrastructure as code workflows.

```shell
poetry run infrahubctl repository add --ref main --read-only infrahub-demo https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-service-catalog.git
```

#### Why Git integration?

This connection enables:

- **Generator Scripts**: Python code that automates service provisioning
- **Configuration Templates**: Jinja2 templates for device configurations
- **Schema**: Track changes to data models over time
- **Objects and data**: Infrastructure changes through pull requests

:::info About Read-Only Mode
The `--read-only` flag means:

- Infrahub can fetch and execute code from the repository
- Changes in Infrahub won't be pushed back to Git
- Perfect for demo environments and testing

For production, you'd typically use bidirectional sync to enable full GitOps workflows.
:::

:::tip Understanding the Data Model
This imports:

- **Locations**: Sites like Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, and Seattle
- **Devices**: Core switches, edge routers, and customer equipment
- **Network Resources**: VLAN pools, IP prefix pools
- **Templates**: Device configurations and service definitions

The schema uses a hierarchical structure:

- Locations contain devices
- Devices have interfaces and connections
- Services allocate resources from pools
- Everything is version-controlled and auditable
:::

## Verify your installation

Confirm everything is working by accessing both interfaces:

### Infrahub web UI

- **URL**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `infrahub`
- **What to Check**:
    - Navigate to the Schema page to see loaded models
    - Check the Objects page to verify demo data is present
    - Confirm the repository appears under Repositories

### Service catalog portal

- **URL**: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
- **What to Check**:
    - Home page displays available services
    - Service request forms are accessible
    - No connection errors appear

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Services won't start

- Ensure Docker is running and has sufficient resources
- Check for port conflicts (8000, 8501, 5432, 6379)
- Run `poetry run invoke destroy` then `poetry run invoke start` to reset

### Schema load fails

- Wait for Infrahub to fully start (check logs with `docker compose logs infrahub`)
- Retry the schema load command after 30 seconds

### Can't access web interfaces

- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check firewall rules if running on a remote server
- Ensure all containers are running: `docker compose ps`

## Next steps

Now that your environment is running:

1. **For Users**: Follow the [user walkthrough](user-walkthrough) to learn how to request services
2. **For Developers**: Check the [developer walkthrough](developer-walkthrough) to understand the architecture
3. **Explore Further**: Browse the Infrahub UI to understand the data model and relationships
