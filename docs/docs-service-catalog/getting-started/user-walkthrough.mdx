- Then, navigate to "Dedicated Internet" using the sidebar.
- Fill out the form to request a new dedicated internet service.
- Submit the request.

### List ongoing requests

## 🧑‍💻 Network architect

The goal as a network architect is to carry out day-to-day operations and implement the requested services.

### View current state of the network

- You can access Infrahub at `http://localhost:8000`.
- Log in with the username `admin` and password `infrahub`.
- On the left sidebar, there are several objects that represent the current state of the network.
- Click `Location` > `Site` to see the list of sites.
- Click on a site to view its details, including the assigned components like VLANs and devices.

:::success

Infrahub can store all the data related to the network, including sites, devices, VLANs, and more, allowing teams to have a centralized view of the network's intended state.

:::

### Review and approve service requests

- Navigate to `Proposed Changes` in the left sidebar.
- You should see an entry for the service request you submitted as a service delivery engineer.
- Click on the entry to view the details of the proposed changes.
- Click the `Checks` tab to review the checks that have been run on the proposed changes (the generator one should be successful).
- Click the `Data` tab; you should see the service data entered earlier.
- Click the `Refresh Diff` button.
- You should now see the full-blown service, including components like VLANs and gateways assigned by the generator.
- Moving back to the `Overview` tab, you can click the `Merge` button to approve the changes.

:::success

As a network architect, the only thing you need to do is review the proposed changes and approve them. Infrahub takes care of allocating the resources and implementing the service exactly as you've defined it in the generator.
