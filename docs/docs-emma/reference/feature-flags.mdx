title: Feature Flags
---

Emma uses feature flags to enable experimental and beta functionality. This allows you to try new features while maintaining stability in production environments.

## Overview

Feature flags in Emma control access to:

- **Experimental features** - Early implementations that may change significantly
- **Beta features** - Stable implementations undergoing final testing
- **Advanced features** - Complex functionality for power users

## Configuration

Set feature flags using the `EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS` environment variable:

```bash
# Single feature
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder"

# Multiple features (comma-separated)
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder,template_builder"
```

## Feature flag management

### Checking active flags

Emma displays active feature flags in several places:

**Settings Panel:**

- Lists all enabled flags
- Shows feature status (Alpha, Beta, Experimental)
- Provides links to feature documentation

**Feature Indicators:**

- Icons next to experimental features
- Tooltips explaining feature status
- Warnings about stability

### Dynamic configuration

Some feature flags can be toggled at runtime:

**Session-level flags** (temporary):

- Set via URL parameters: `?features=query_builder,template_builder`
- Override environment variables for testing
- Reset when browser session ends

**User preferences** (persistent):

- Stored in browser local storage
- Survive browser restarts
- Can be cleared via settings panel

### Validation and error handling

Emma validates feature flags on startup:

**Valid flag formats:**

```bash
# Correct
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder,template_builder"

# Also correct (spaces are stripped)
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder, template_builder"
```

**Invalid configurations:**

```bash
# Unknown flags are ignored with warnings
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="invalid_flag,query_builder"
# Warning: Unknown feature flag 'invalid_flag' ignored

# Empty values are acceptable
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS=""
```

## Best practices

### Development environments

**Enable experimental features** for testing:

```bash
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="query_builder,template_builder,ai_suggestions"
```

**Benefits:**

- Access to latest functionality
- Opportunity to provide feedback
- Early adoption of useful features

**Considerations:**

- Features may break or change
- Performance may be sub-optimal
- Some features require additional setup

### Production environments

**Use only stable features** in production:

```bash
# Only enable well-tested features
export EMMA_FEATURE_FLAGS="advanced_import"
```

**Recommended approach:**

1. Test features in development first
2. Enable beta features in staging
3. Only use stable features in production
4. Monitor for issues after enabling new features

### Team deployments

**Coordinate feature usage** across teams:

- Document which features are enabled in each environment
- Communicate feature changes to team members
- Provide training for new experimental features
- Establish rollback procedures

## Feature lifecycle

Emma features follow a development lifecycle:

- **Stability:** May be removed or significantly changed
- **Support:** Limited documentation and support
- **Recommendation:** Development environments only

### Alpha

- **Stability:** Basic functionality works, interfaces may change
- **Support:** Basic documentation, community support
- **Recommendation:** Development and staging environments

### Beta

- **Purpose:** Feature complete, undergoing final testing
- **Stability:** Stable functionality, minor interface changes possible
- **Support:** Full documentation, supported by team
- **Recommendation:** Safe for production with monitoring

### Stable

- **Purpose:** Production-ready feature
- **Stability:** Fully stable, changes follow deprecation policy
- **Support:** Full support and documentation
- **Recommendation:** Safe for all environments

### Deprecated

- **Purpose:** Feature being phased out
- **Stability:** Still works but may be removed in future versions
- **Support:** Limited support, migration guidance provided
- **Recommendation:** Plan migration to replacement features

## Migration and compatibility

### Version compatibility

Feature flags may change between Emma versions:

**Major versions**, for example: 1.x to 2.x:

- Feature flags may be renamed or removed
- New features may be added
- Check migration guide for changes

**Minor versions**, for example: 1.1 to 1.2:

- New features may be added
- Existing features may change status
- Backward compatibility maintained

**Patch versions**, for example: 1.1.1 to 1.1.2:

- Feature flags unchanged
- Bug fixes only

### Feature graduation

When experimental features become stable:

1. **Feature flag removed** - Feature becomes always available
2. **Configuration maintained** - No changes to your setup required
3. **Documentation updated** - Feature moves to main documentation
4. **Migration period** - Old flag maintained temporarily for compatibility

### Deprecation process

When features are deprecated:

1. **Deprecation notice** - Warning in documentation and UI
2. **Migration guide** - Instructions for moving to replacement
3. **Grace period** - Feature continues to work for several versions
4. **Removal** - Feature flag and functionality removed

## Troubleshooting feature flags

### Common issues

**Feature not appearing:**

- Check feature flag spelling
- Verify environment variable is set correctly
- Restart Emma after changing environment variables
- Check Emma logs for feature flag warnings

**Feature causing issues:**

- Disable the feature flag temporarily
- Check feature-specific documentation
- Report issues with feature flag and Emma version information

**Performance problems:**

- Some experimental features may impact performance
- Disable CPU-intensive features if needed
- Monitor system resources when testing new features

### Getting help

When reporting feature flag issues:

1. **Include Emma version** and deployment method
2. **List active feature flags** from your configuration
3. **Describe the specific feature** causing issues
4. **Provide steps to reproduce** the problem
5. **Include relevant logs** with feature flag context

### Feedback and contributions

Emma's experimental features benefit from user feedback:

- **Test new features** and report issues
- **Suggest improvements** for experimental interfaces
- **Share use cases** for features you find valuable
- **Contribute documentation** for features you use

Feature flags allow Emma to evolve rapidly while maintaining stability. Use them to access cutting-edge functionality and help shape Emma's future development.
