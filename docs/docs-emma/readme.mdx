Emma is the experimental little sister of Otto, and she is to help you interact with Infrahub.

Currently, Emma can help you to:

- Import CSV Data into Infrahub
- Export Data from Infrahub in CSV format
- Build, Load, and Visualize the Infrahub schema

:::warning
Emma is experimental by design, and may not work as expected. She tests out new ideas before her big brother Otto gets involved and implements them in Infrahub.

## Getting Started

### curl quickstart
