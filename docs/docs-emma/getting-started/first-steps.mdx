Welcome to Emma! This guide will walk you through your first experience using Emma to interact with Infrahub.

## Opening Emma

1. **Navigate to Emma** at http://localhost:8501 (or your configured port)
2. **Verify connection** - Emma should show a connection status to your Infrahub instance
3. **Select a branch** - Choose which Infrahub branch to work with (usually `main`)

## Understanding Emma's interface

Emma is organized into several key areas accessible from the sidebar:

### Core features

- **üèóÔ∏è Schema Builder** - AI-powered schema creation and editing
- **üìÅ Schema Library** - Browse and use pre-built schema templates
- **üîÑ Schema Loader** - Load schemas into your Infrahub instance
- **üëÅÔ∏è Schema Visualizer** - Visual representation of your schemas
- **üì• Data Importer** - Import CSV data into Infrahub
- **üì§ Data Exporter** - Export Infrahub data to CSV

### Experimental features

- **üîç Query Builder** - Build GraphQL queries (feature flag required)
- **üìã Template Builder** - Create templates (feature flag required)

## Your first task: explore the schema library

Let's start by exploring Emma's schema library:

1. **Click "Schema Library"** in the sidebar
2. **Browse available schemas** - You'll see categories like Base, Extensions, and Experimental
3. **Select a schema** to view its details, such as the "Device" schema from Base/DCIM
4. **Review the schema structure** - Notice how it defines attributes, relationships, and inheritance

This gives you an understanding of how Infrahub schemas are structured.

## Load your first schema

Next, let's load a schema into Infrahub:

1. **Navigate to "Schema Loader"**
2. **Select schemas** from the library (start with Base schemas like Organization and Location)
3. **Preview the schema** to understand what will be loaded
4. **Click "Load Schema"** to add it to your Infrahub instance

:::tip
Start with foundational schemas like Organization and Location before adding more complex schemas that depend on them.

## Visualize your schema

After loading schemas:

1. **Go to "Schema Visualizer"**
2. **View the graphical representation** of your schema relationships
3. **Explore connections** between different schema objects
4. **Use filters** to focus on specific schema types or relationships

## Import sample data

To see Emma in action with real data:

1. **Prepare a CSV file** with data matching your schema structure
2. **Navigate to "Data Importer"**
3. **Upload your CSV** and map columns to schema attributes
4. **Preview the import** to verify mappings are correct
5. **Execute the import** to add data to Infrahub

## Key concepts to understand

### Schemas vs data

- **Schemas** define the structure and relationships of your infrastructure models
- **Data** is the actual instances that follow those schemas (specific devices, locations, etc.)

### Branches

- Emma works with Infrahub branches, similar to Git branches
- Changes can be made in development branches before merging to main
- Always be aware of which branch you're working in

### AI integration

- Emma's Schema Builder uses AI to help create schemas from natural language
- The AI understands infrastructure concepts and can suggest appropriate attributes and relationships
- Review AI-generated schemas carefully before using them in production

## Next steps

Now that you've completed your first steps:

1. **Explore Features** - Learn about each feature in detail in the [Features](../features/schema-builder) section
2. **Follow Guides** - Try the step-by-step [guides](../guides/building-your-first-schema) for common tasks
3. **Build Your Own** - Start creating schemas and importing data for your infrastructure
