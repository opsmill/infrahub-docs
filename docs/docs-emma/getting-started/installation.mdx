Emma is an experimental AI-powered assistant for Infrahub that helps you manage infrastructure schemas and data through an intuitive web interface.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Emma, ensure you have:

- **Infrahub instance**: Emma requires a running Infrahub instance to connect to
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment) or **Python 3.10+** and **uv** (for local development)

## Installation methods

<TabItem value="quickstart" label="Quick Start (Recommended)" default>

The easiest way to get started is using the Infrahub quickstart with Emma included:

```bash
# Download and start Infrahub + Emma with Docker Compose
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/1.6.2-emma | docker compose -f - up -d
```

This command will:

- Download the latest Infrahub and Emma configuration
- Start both services with proper networking
- Make Emma available at `http://localhost:8501`
- Make Infrahub available at `http://localhost:8000`

:::tip
Update the version number in the URL to the [latest Infrahub release](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/tags) for the most recent features.

## Next steps

After installation, proceed to [Configuration](./configuration) to set up your connection to Infrahub.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

- **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 8501 (Emma) and 8000 (Infrahub) are available
- **Docker issues**: Check Docker is running and you have sufficient resources allocated
- **Network connectivity**: Verify Emma can reach your Infrahub instance

For more detailed troubleshooting, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](../reference/troubleshooting).
