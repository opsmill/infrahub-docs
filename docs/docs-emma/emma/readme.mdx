Emma is the experimental little sister of Otto, and she is to help you interact with Infrahub.

Currently, Emma can help you to:

- Import CSV Data into Infrahub
- Export Data from Infrahub in CSV format
- Build, Load, and Visualize the Infrahub schema

!!! warning

Emma is experimental by design, and may not work as expected. She tests out new ideas before her big brother Otto gets involved and implements them in Infrahub.

## Getting Started

### curl quickstart

This command will use the [Infrahub Quickstart](https://docs.infrahub.app/guides/installation#quick-start-via-curl) method to download a Docker Compose file and start Infrahub and Emma. Note the Infrahub version number in the URL should be updated to the [latest version](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub/tags).

```console
curl https://infrahub.opsmill.io/1.1.2-emma | docker compose -f - up -d
```

Then connect to the WebUI of [Infrahub](http://localhost:8000) and [Emma](http://localhost:8501)
